1.  📖 If you have not done so already, read 
    [An overview of Data Analysis in R for BABS in your degree](../../index.qmd) 
    and [An overview of Data Analysis in R for BABS 1](../r4babs1.qmd). Both are also 
    linked on the VLE.

2.  📖 Read [What they forgot to teach you about computers](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/what-they-forgot.html) in [Computational Analysis for Bioscientists](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/)

3.  📖 Read [What are R and Rstudio?](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/about-R-and-RStudio.html). 
    You only need to read *this* section, you do not need to the read the
    rest of the chapter (yet!)

4.  🖥️ Join the video conference Intro: Data Handling - BIO00027C-A (Lecture) 
    on your timetable. The main purpose of this session is to highlight how
    Data Analysis in R for BABS 1 is organised and give you an opportunity to 
    ask questions.
