This week you will carry out some independent study to ensure you 
have some understanding of computer file systems. We will introduce 
you to the concepts of paths and working directories. You will also 
set your own machine up to use the Virtual Desktop Service which allows
you to log in to a university machine from your own computer so you 
can work easily at home outside of workshops.
