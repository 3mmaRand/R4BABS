There is no formal workshop this week but yu might want to install R and RStudio on your own machine. This is optional because University computers already have R and RStudio installed.

[Install R and RStudio](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/first_steps_rstudio.html#installing-r-and-rstudio).

Note you need a computer - not a tablet.
