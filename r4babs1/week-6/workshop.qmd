There is no formal workshop this week but I recommend setting yourself
up to work from home

1.  ðŸ’» Set up the Virtual Desktop. I recommend working on the University
    computers for this work. Installing R and RStudio is almost always
    straightforward but many people are still developing their computing
    skills. If you sometimes have difficulty updating and or installing
    software on your own machine, wouldn't know what what versions of R
    and RStudio you are using or don't realise there is a difference
    between R and RStudio you will likely avoid trouble by using the
    university machines. The uni machines always have up-to-date R and R
    packages and all the packages that appear in teaching materials. You
    can still work from home by using the [Virtual Desktop
    Service](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/tools/vds/). The VDS
    allows you to log on to a university computer from your own
    computer. It means you can access all software and filestores. When
    using the VDS for R and RStudio, it usually makes sense to use other
    software - such as a browser or file explorer - also through the
    VDS. Go to the [Virtual Desktop
    Service](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/tools/vds/) for set up
    instructions.

    However, If you are confident in your ability to set up your own
    machine, you need:

    -   to know there is a [difference between R and
        RStudio](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/about-R-and-RStudio.html)
    -   [Install R and
        Rstudio](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/about-R-and-RStudio.html#installing-r-and-rstudio)
    -   to us R 4.5 and RStudio RStudio 2025.05.0+496 "Mariposa Orchid"
        Release
    -   to be certain you are actually using R 4.5 - it is written in
        the top edge of the console window. By default RStudio uses the
        *latest* version on R on your machine.

    It is possible to access all your files on your university account
    without using the VDS. For example, if you want to work on uni
    machines at uni and your machine at home. You can best do this by
    [mapping a
    drive](https://support.york.ac.uk/s/topic/0TO4K000000lA5ZWAU/filestores).
    If you store everything on google drive you can also read/write to
    that like any other drive using google drive app.

Set up the [Virtual Desktop
Service](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/tools/vds/) NOW even if you
plan to use your own machine. This means you will always have that
option if your own set causes a problem.
