There is no formal workshop this week but I recommend setting yourself up to
work from home

1.  ðŸ’» Set up the Virtual Desktop. I recommend working on 
    the University computers for this work. Installing R and RStudio 
    is almost always straightforward but many people are still developing
    their computing skills. If you sometimes have difficulty updating 
    and or installing software on your own machine, wouldn't know what 
    what versions of R and RStudio you are using or don't realise there 
    is a difference between R and RStudio you will likely avoid trouble
    by using the university machines. The uni machines always have 
    up-to-date R and R packages and all the packages that appear in 
    teaching materials. You can still work from home by using the
    [Virtual Desktop Service](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/tools/vds/). 
    The VDS allows you to log on to a university computer from your 
    own computer. It means you can access all software and filestores. 
    When using the VDS for R and RStudio, it usually makes sense to use 
    other software - such as a browser or file explorer - also through the VDS.
    
    However, If you are confident in your ability to set up your own machine, you 
    need:
    
    -   to know there is a 
        [difference between R and RStudio](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/first_steps_rstudio.html#what-are-r-and-rstudio)
    -   [Install R and Rstudio](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/first_steps_rstudio.html#installing-r-and-rstudio)
    -   to using R 4.4 and RStudio 2024.09.0 Build 375 ("Cranberry Hibiscus")
    -   be certain you are actually using R 4.4 - it is written in the top edge
        of the console window. By default RStudio uses the latest version on 
        R on your machine. 

    It is possible to access all your files on your university account without 
    using the VDS. For example, if you want to work on uni machines at uni 
    and your machine at home. You can best do this by mapping a drive:      
    https://support.york.ac.uk/s/topic/0TO4K000000lA5ZWAU/filestores.
    If you store everything on google drive you can also read/write to that 
    like any other drive using google drive app.


Even if you plan to use your own machine I really recommend you take 
the time to set the VDS up now while you're not time pressured so you 
always have that option ready.
