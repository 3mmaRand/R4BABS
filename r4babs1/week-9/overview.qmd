Last week you summarised and plotted data sets with one variable. This
week you will start plotting data sets with more than one variable. This
means you need to be able determine which variable is the response and
which is the explanatory. You will find out what is meant by "tidy" data
and how to perform a simple data tidying task. Finally you will discover
how to save your figures to file.

### Learning objectives

-   summarise and plot, appropriately, datasets with more than one
    variable
-   recognise that variables can be categorised by their role in
    analysis
-   explain what is meant by 'tidy' data and be able to perform some
    data tidying tasks.
-   save figures to file by scripting
