subtitle: "Week 9: Summarising data in with several variables and the role of variables in analysis"
---

Last week you summarised and plotted single variables. This week you will start plotting data sets with more than one variable. This means you need to be able determine which variable is the response and which is the explanatory. You will find out what is meant by "tidy" data and how to perform a simple data tidying task. Finally you will discover how to save your figures and place them in documents.




### Learning objectives

-   summarise and plot appropriately datasets with more than one variable
-   recognise that variables can be categorised by their role in analysis
-   explain what is meant by 'tidy' data and be able to perform some data tidying tasks.
-   save figures to file
-   create neat reports which include text and figures
