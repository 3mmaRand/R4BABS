Last week you summarised and plotted single variables. This week you will start plotting data sets with more than one variable. This means you need to be able determine which variable is the response and which is the explanatory. You will find out what is meant by "tidy" data and how to perform a simple data tidying task. You will also learn how to read data into R from files.
