title: "Data Analysis in R for BABS 1"
---

# Introduction

first of 4 babs modules. four weeks of work.
findaental computing concepts
data types, types of variable, role of variables
ideas about data organisation 
using rstudio
importing summarising and plotting variables


## Module Learning Objectives

The BABS1 Module Learning outcomes that relate to the Data Analysis in R content are:

Methodically record scientific investigations with lab books, organise data and use R to import, summarise and plot simple data sets.

Explain the key features of effective written media for dissemination of scientific information and be able to communicate experimental results through a scientific poster.

# How this part of the module is organised

Week 6 starts with some independent study to ensure you have some understanding of computer file systems and will introduce you to the concepts of paths and working directories. In weeks 7, 8 and 9 there is some independent covering concepts about data followed by a workshop where you apply these concepts in R. There will be independent study after the workshop to consolidate your learning.

## Week 6: Understand file systems

### Learning objectives

files and directories
file names, file extensions, associations with programs
using a file explorer
saving files
finding files
paths
using google

### Instructions

-   Understand file systems Directed Study 1 hr
e

## Week 7: Introduction to R, RStudio and project organisation
(17C week 2 minus stats) Data structures in R

### Learning objectives
-   use the R command line as a calculator and to assign variables

-   create and use the basic data types in R

-   find their way around the RStudio windows 

-   use an RStudio Project to organise work

-   use a script to run R commands

-   create and customise a barplot

-   search and understand manual pages


### Instructions
-   intro and datatype Directed Study 1 hr

-   Introduction to R, RStudio and project organisation Workshop 2hr

-   Exercises based on workshop 1 Directed Study 0.5 hr

## Week 8: Types of variable, the normal distribution and summarising data

(week 3 of 17C minus logic of hyp testing) More working directories and paths. Types of variables. Import one variable, text. summarising data, role of data types in types of summary.  the normal distribution, sample distribution of the mean. Making reports

### Learning objectives

-   distinguish between data types

-   normal distribution stuff

-   read in data in to RStudio from a plain text file

-   summarise and plot single-variable datasets  

-   chose summary statistics and plots appropriate for the data type
-   save figures to file

-   create neat reports in Word which include text and figures



### Instructions

-   Types of variable, the normal distribution and summarising data Directed Study 1 hr

-   Types of variable, the normal distribution and summarising data Workshop 2 hr

-   Exercises based on workshop 2 Directed Study 0.5 hr

## Week 9: Summarising data in with several variables and the role of variables in analysis

(based on aspects of 2nd week and 3rd week 17C).  data import more than one variable, role of data types in analysis/plots, summarising data in with several variables, different plots for different types of data. File types, importing different file types


### Learning objectives

-   describe some different file types

-   read in data in to RStudio from excel files

-   summarise and plot datasets with more than one variable

-   recognise that variables can be categorised by their role in analysis

-   chose summary statistics and plots appropriate for the data types and roles

-   explain what is meant by 'tidy' data and be able to perform some data tidying tasks.


### Instructions

-   Summarising data in with several variables and the role of variables in analysis Directed Study 1 hr

-   Summarising data in with several variables and the role of variables in analysis Workshop 2 hr

-   Exercises based on workshop 3 Directed Study 0.5 hr
