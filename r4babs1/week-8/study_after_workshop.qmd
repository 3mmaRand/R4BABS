### means of counts

![](images/do_in_R.png) Summarise the `fly_bristles_means` dataframe by calculating the mean, median, sample size and standard deviation of `mean_count`. 

```{r}
#| include: false

#---CODING ANSWER---
cells |> 
  summarise(mean = mean(FSC),
            meadian = median(FSC),
            n = length(FSC),
            standard_dev = sd(FSC))
```

![](images/do_in_R.png) Create an appropriate plot of `fly_bristles_means` dataframe by calculating the mean, median, sample size and standard deviation of `mean_count`. 



formatting graphs from last week: axis, order of bars, colour of bars



```{r}
ggplot(cats, aes(x = coat, y = mass)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

[Changing the order of bars](r4babs1/week-7/workshop.html#changing-the-order-of-bars) from last week.

```{r}
ggplot(cats, aes(x = reorder(coat, mass), y = mass)) +
  geom_boxplot()
