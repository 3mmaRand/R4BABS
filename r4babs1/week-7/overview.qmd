subtitle: "Week 7: Introduction to R, RStudio and project organisation"
---

This week you will start writing R code in RStudio and will create your first graph! You will learn about data types such as "numerics" and "characters" and some of the different types of objects in R such as "vectors" and "dataframes". These are the building blocks for the rest of your R journey. You will also learn a workflow and about the layout of RStudio and using RStudio Projects.
