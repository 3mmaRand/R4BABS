Use an RStudio project containing the script you used to analyse and plot the data for your report, your figures and  and the data itself. The Project should be structured and the script should be well-commented, well-organised and follow good practice in the use of spacing, indentation, and variable naming. It should include all the code required to reproduce data import and formatting as well as the summary information, analyses, and figures in your report.
