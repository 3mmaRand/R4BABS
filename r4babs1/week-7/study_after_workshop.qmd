# Set up

If you have just opened RStudio you will want to load the **`tidyverse`** package

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
library(tidyverse)
```

# Exercises

1.  ðŸ’» In a maternity hospital, the total numbers of births induced on each day of the week over a six week period were recorded (see table below). Create a plot of these data with the days of week in order.

```{r}
#| echo: false
day <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
freq <- c(43, 36, 35, 38, 48, 26, 24) 
inductions <- data.frame(day, freq)
knitr::kable(inductions, 
             table.attr = "style='width:50%;'",
             caption = "Number of inductions for each day of the week over six weeks.",
             format = "html",
             col.names = c("Day", "No. inductions"),
             row.names = FALSE) |>  
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

```{r}
#| output: false

# create a dataframe for the data
day <- c("Monday", 
         "Tuesday", 
         "Wednesday",
         "Thursday",
         "Friday",
         "Saturday",
         "Sunday")
freq <- c(43, 36, 35, 38, 48, 26, 24) 
inductions <- data.frame(day, freq)

# make the order of the days correct rather than alphabetical
inductions <- inductions |> 
  mutate(day = fct_relevel(day, c("Monday",
                                  "Tuesday",
                                  "Wednesday",
                                  "Thursday",
                                  "Friday",
                                  "Saturday",
                                  "Sunday")))

# plot the data as a barplot with the bars in
ggplot(data = inductions, 
       aes(x = day, y = freq)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black",
           fill = "lightseagreen") +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0),
                   name = "Day of the week") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),
                     name = "Number of inductions",
                     limits = c(0, 55)) +
  theme_classic()
```
