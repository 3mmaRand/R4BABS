    "text": "Customising the plot\n Change the fill of the bars using fill:\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, aes(x = coat, y = freq)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\nColours can be given by their name, ‚Äúlightblue‚Äù or code, ‚Äú#ADD8E6‚Äù.\nLook up by name or code\n Change the bars to a colour you like.\nfill is one of the arguments covered by .... fill is an ‚Äòaesthetic‚Äô. If you look for ... in the list of arguments you will see it says:\n\nOther arguments passed on to layer(). These are often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like colour = ‚Äúred‚Äù or size = 3. They may also be parameters to the paired geom/stat.\n\nWe just set the `fill` aesthetic to a fixed value.\nFurther down the manual, there is a section on Aesthetics which lists those understood by geom_col()\nWe can set (map) the fill aesthetic to a fixed colour inside geom_col() or map it to a variable from the dataframe inside the aes() instead. This means the colour will be different for different values in that variable.\n Map the fill aesthetic to the coat variable:\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, aes(x = coat, y = freq, fill = coat)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have taken fill = \"lightblue\" out of the geom_col() and instead put fill = coat in the aes().\n Use the manual to put the bars next to each other. Look for the argument that will mean there is no space between the bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use the manual to change the colour of the lines around each bar to black.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make changes to the axes using:\n\nChanges to a discrete x axis: scale_x_discrete()\n\nChanges to a continuous y axis: scale_y_continuous()\n\n\nggplot automatically extends the axes slightly. You can turn this behaviour off with the expand argument in scale_x_discrete() and scale_y_continuous().1\n Remove the gap between the axes and the data:\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, aes(x = coat, y = freq)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"lightblue\", \n           width = 1, \n           colour = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) \n\n\n\n\nEach ‚Äòlayer‚Äô is added to the ggplot() command with a +\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Tip\n\n\n\nMake your code easier to read by using white space and new lines\n\nput spaces around = , -&gt; and after ,\n\nuse a newline after every comma in a command with lots of arguments\n\n\n\n Look up scale_x_discrete in the manual and work out how to change the axis title from ‚Äúcoat‚Äù to ‚ÄúCoat colour‚Äù. Also change the y-axis title.\n\n\n\n\n\n I would prefer to see the y-axis extend a little beyond the data and we can change the axis ‚Äúlimits‚Äù in the scale_y_continuous()\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, aes(x = coat, y = freq)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"lightblue\", \n           width = 1, \n           colour = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0),\n                   name = \"Coat colour\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),\n                     name = \"Number of cats\",\n                     limits = c(0, 25)) \n\n\n\n\nThe grey grid background is useful for examining plots on a screen but for a report of publication you will want a more scientific style. Every aspect of the ‚Äútheme‚Äù of a plot - the non-data elements such as fonts, background colours, axis line colours etc - can be controlled individually2 but there are some handy built in themes that apply several changes at once. One of these is theme_classic()\n Add theme_classic() to the plot:\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, aes(x = coat, y = freq)) +\n  geom_col(width = 1, \n           colour = \"black\",\n           fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0),\n                   name = \"Coat colour\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),\n                     name = \"Number of cats\",\n                     limits = c(0, 25)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\nThe default ordering of a categorical variable like coat is alphabetical. Often we want to change the order. For example, you might want a ‚ÄúControl‚Äù on the left or the categories might have an inherent order (e.g., small, medium and large). We can alter (mutate) the coat variable using fct_relevel().\n Make ‚Äúwhite‚Äù the first category:\n\ncoat_data &lt;- coat_data |&gt; \n  mutate(coat = fct_relevel(coat, \"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pipe |&gt;\n\n\n\n|&gt; is called the ‚Äúpipe‚Äù. A keyboard shortcut is Control+Shift+M\nThe pipe puts the output of one command (one the left) as input to another command (on the right). It can be read as ‚Äúand then‚Äù. You will more about it next week.\n\n\n Now plot again.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted white and then ginger you would do fct_relevel(coat, c(\"white\", \"ginger\")\nWe can also order the categories by the values in another variable by using reorder() in the plot code.\n Reorder the categories in coat by the the value in freq:\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, \n       aes(x = reorder(coat, freq, decreasing = TRUE), \n           y = freq)) +\n  geom_col(width = 1, \n           colour = \"black\",\n           fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0),\n                   name = \"Coat colour\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),\n                     name = \"Number of cats\",\n                     limits = c(0, 25)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôre finished!"
