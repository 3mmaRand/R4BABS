If you look for ... in the list of arguments you will see it says:\n\nOther arguments passed on to layer(). These are often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like colour = “red” or size = 3. They may also be parameters to the paired geom/stat.\n\nWe just set the `fill` aesthetic to a fixed value.\nFurther down the manual, there is a section on Aesthetics which lists those understood by geom_col()\nWe can set (map) the fill aesthetic to a fixed colour inside geom_col() or map it to a variable from the dataframe inside the aes() instead. This means the colour will be different for different values in that variable.\n Map the fill aesthetic to the coat variable:\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, aes(x = coat, y = freq, fill = coat)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have taken fill = \"lightblue\" out of the geom_col() and instead put fill = coat in the aes().\n Use the manual to put the bars next to each other. Look for the argument that will mean there is no space between the bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use the manual to change the colour of the lines around each bar to black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the axes\nWe can make changes to the axes using:\n\nChanges to a discrete x axis: scale_x_discrete()\nChanges to a continuous y axis: scale_y_continuous()\n\nggplot automatically extends the axes slightly. You can turn this behaviour off with the expand argument in scale_x_discrete() and scale_y_continuous().1\n Remove the gap between the axes and the data:\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, aes(x = coat, y = freq)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"lightblue\", \n           width = 1, \n           colour = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) \n\n\n\n\nEach ‘layer’ is added to the ggplot() command with a +\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Tip\n\n\n\nMake your code easier to read by using white space and new lines\n\nput spaces around = , -&gt; and after ,\nuse a newline after every comma in a command with lots of arguments\n\n\n\n Look up scale_x_discrete in the manual and work out how to change the axis title from “coat” to “Coat colour”. Also change the y-axis title.\n\n\n\n\n\n I would prefer to see the y-axis extend a little beyond the data and we can change the axis “limits” in the scale_y_continuous()\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, aes(x = coat, y = freq)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"lightblue\", \n           width = 1, \n           colour = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0),\n                   name = \"Coat colour\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),\n                     name = \"Number of cats\",\n                     limits = c(0, 25)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting rid of the grey background\nThe grey grid background is useful for examining plots on a screen but for a report of publication you will want a more scientific style. Every aspect of the “theme” of a plot - the non-data elements such as fonts, background colours, axis line colours etc - can be controlled individually2 but there are some handy built in themes that apply several changes at once. One of these is theme_classic()\n Add theme_classic() to the plot:\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, aes(x = coat, y = freq)) +\n  geom_col(width = 1, \n           colour = \"black\",\n           fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0),\n                   name = \"Coat colour\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),\n                     name = \"Number of cats\",\n                     limits = c(0, 25)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the order of bars\nThe default ordering of a categorical variable like coat is alphabetical. Often we want to change the order. For example, you might want a “Control” on the left or the categories might have an inherent order (e.g., small, medium and large). We can alter (mutate) the coat variable using fct_relevel().\n Make “white” the first category:\n\ncoat_data &lt;- coat_data |&gt; \n  mutate(coat = fct_relevel(coat, \"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pipe |&gt;\n\n\n\n|&gt; is called the “pipe”. A keyboard shortcut is Control+Shift+M\nThe pipe puts the output of one command (one the left) as input to another command (on the right). It can be read as “and then”. You will more about it next week.\n\n\n Now plot again.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted white and then ginger you would do fct_relevel(coat, c(\"white\", \"ginger\")\nWe can also order the categories by the values in another variable by using reorder() in the plot code.\n Reorder the categories in coat by the the value in freq:\n\nggplot(data = coat_data, \n       aes(x = reorder(coat, freq, decreasing = TRUE), \n           y = freq)) +\n  geom_col(width = 1, \n           colour = \"black\",\n           fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0),\n                   name = \"Coat colour\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),\n                     name = \"Number of cats\",\n                     limits = c(0, 25)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\nYou’re finished!"

    "text": "Myoglobin in seal muscle\nThe myoglobin concentration of skeletal muscle of three species of seal in grams per kilogram of muscle was determined and the data are given in seal.csv. Each row represents an individual seal. The first column gives the myoglobin concentration and the second column indicates species.\n\nImport\n Save seal.csv to your data-raw folder\n Read the data into a dataframe called seal. . You might want to look up data import from last week.\n What types of variables do you have in the seal dataframe? What role would you expect them to play in analysis?\n\n\n\n\nThe key point here is that the fundamental structure of:\n\none continuous response and one nominal explanatory variable with two groups (adipocytes), and\none continuous response and one nominal explanatory variable with three groups (seals)\n\nis the same! The only thing that differs is the number of groups (the number of values in the nominal variable). This means the code for summarising and plotting is identical except for the variable names!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen two datasets have the same number of columns and the response variable and the explanatory variables have the same data types then the code you need is the same.\n\n\n\n\nSummarise\nSummarising the data for each species is the next sensible step. The most useful summary statistics for a continuous variable like myoglobin are the means, standard deviations, sample sizes and standard errors. You might remember from last week that we use the group_by() and summarise() functions along with the functions that do the calculations.\n Create a data frame called seal_summary that contains the means, standard deviations, sample sizes and standard errors for the control and nicotinic acid treated samples.\n\nseal_summary &lt;- seal %&gt;%\n  group_by(species) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean = mean(myoglobin),\n            std = sd(myoglobin),\n            n = length(myoglobin),\n            se = std/sqrt(n))\n\nYou should get the following numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nmean\nstd\nn\nse\n\n\n\n\nBladdernose Seal\n42.31600\n8.020634\n30\n1.464361\n\n\nHarbour Seal\n49.01033\n8.252004\n30\n1.506603\n\n\nWeddell Seal\n44.66033\n7.849816\n30\n1.433174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualise\nMost commonly, we put the explanatory variable on the x axis and the response variable on the y axis. A continuous response, particularly one that follows the normal distribution, is best summarised with the mean and the standard error. In my opinion, you should also show all the raw data points if possible.\nWe are going to create a figure like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this figure, we have the data points themselves which are in seal dataframe and the means and standard errors which are in the seal_summary dataframe. That is, we have two dataframes we want to plot.\nHere you will learn that dataframes and aesthetics can be specified within a geom_xxxx (rather than in the ggplot()). This is very useful if the geom only applies to some of the data you want to plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: ggplot()\n\n\n\nYou put the data argument and aes() inside ggplot() if you want all the geoms to use that dataframe and variables. If you want a different dataframe for a geom, put the data argument and aes() inside the geom_xxxx()\n\n\nI will build the plot up in small steps but you should edit your existing ggplot() command as we go.\n Plot the data points first.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = seal, \n             aes(x = species, y = myoglobin))\n\n\n\n\nNotice how we have given the data argument and the aesthetics inside the geom. The variables species and myoglobin are in the seal dataframe\n So the data points don’t overlap, we can add some random jitter in the x direction (edit your existing code):\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = seal, \n             aes(x = species, y = myoglobin),\n             position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0))\n\n\n\n\nNote that position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0) is inside the geom_point() parentheses, after the aes() and a comma.\nWe’ve set the vertical jitter to 0 because, in contrast to the categorical x-axis, movement on the y-axis has meaning (the myoglobin levels).\n Let’s make the points a light grey (edit your existing code):\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = seal, \n             aes(x = species, y = myoglobin),\n             position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),\n             colour = \"grey50\")\n\n\n\n\nNow to add the errorbars. These go from one standard error below the mean to one standard error above the mean.\n Add a geom_errorbar() for errorbars (edit your existing code):\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = seal, aes(x = species, y = myoglobin),\n             position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),\n             colour = \"grey50\") +\n  geom_errorbar(data = seal_summary, \n                aes(x = species, ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se),\n                width = 0.3) \n\n\n\n\nWe have specified the seal_summary dataframe and the variables species, mean and se are in that.\nThere are several ways you could add the mean. You could use geom_point() but I like to use geom_errorbar() again with the ymin and ymax both set to the mean.\n Add a geom_errorbar() for the mean (edit your existing code):\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = seal, aes(x = species, y = myoglobin),\n             position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),\n             colour = \"grey50\") +\n  geom_errorbar(data = seal_summary, \n                aes(x = species, ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se),\n                width = 0.3) +\n  geom_errorbar(data = seal_summary, \n                aes(x = species, ymin = mean, ymax = mean),\n                width = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n Alter the axis labels and limits using scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_discrete() (edit your existing code):\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = seal, aes(x = species, y = myoglobin),\n             position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),\n             colour = \"grey50\") +\n  geom_errorbar(data = seal_summary, \n                aes(x = species, ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se),\n                width = 0.3) +\n  geom_errorbar(data = seal_summary, \n                aes(x = species, ymin = mean, ymax = mean),\n                width = 0.2) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Myoglobin (g/kg)\", \n                     limits = c(0, 80), \n                     expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"Species\")\n\n\n\n\nYou only need to use scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_discrete() to use labels that are different from those in the dataset. Often this is to use proper terminology and captialisation.\n Format the figure in a way that is more suitable for including in a report using theme_classic() (edit your existing code):\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = seal, aes(x = species, y = myoglobin),\n             position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),\n             colour = \"grey50\") +\n  geom_errorbar(data = seal_summary, \n                aes(x = species, ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se),\n                width = 0.3) +\n  geom_errorbar(data = seal_summary, \n                aes(x = species, ymin = mean, ymax = mean),\n                width = 0.2) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Myoglobin (g/kg)\", \n                     limits = c(0, 80), \n                     expand = c(0, 0)) +\n   scale_x_discrete(name = \"Species\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting figures to file\n Make a new folder called figures.\n Edit you ggplot code so that you assign the figure to a variable.\n\nsealfig &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = seal, aes(x = species, y = myoglobin),\n             position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),\n             colour = \"grey50\") +\n  geom_errorbar(data = seal_summary, \n                aes(x = species, ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se),\n                width = 0.3) +\n  geom_errorbar(data = seal_summary, \n                aes(x = species, ymin = mean, ymax = mean),\n                width = 0.2) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Myoglobin (g/kg)\", \n                     limits = c(0, 80), \n                     expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"Species\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\nThe figure won’t be shown in the Plots tab - the output has gone into sealfig rather than to the Plots tab.

    "text": "Importing data from files\nLast week we created data by typing the values in to R. This is not practical when you have added a lot of data to a spreadsheet, or you are using data file that has been supplied to you by a person or a machine. Far more commonly, we import data from a file into R. This requires you know two pieces of information.\n\nWhat format the data are in\nThe format of the data determines what function you will use to import it and the file extension often indicates format.\n\n.txt a plain text file1, where the columns are often separated by a space but might also be separated by a tab, a backslash or forward slash, or some other character\n.csv a plain text file where the columns are separated by commas\n.xlsx an Excel file\n\nWhere the file is relative to your working directory\nR can only read in a file if you say where it is, i.e., you give its relative path. If you follow the advice in this course, your data will be in a folder, data-raw which is inside your Project folder (and working directory).\n\nWe will save the four files for this workshop to our Project folder (week-8) and read them in. We will then create a new folder inside our Project folder called data-raw and move the data files to there before modifying the file paths as required. This is demonstrate how the relative path to the file will change after we move it.\n Save these four files in to your week-8 folder\n\nThe coat colour and mass of 62 cats: cat-coats.csv\nThe relative size of over 5000 cells measure by forward scatter (FSC) in flow cytometry: cell-size.txt\nThe number of sternopleural bristles on 96 female Drosophila: bristles.txt\nThe number of sternopleural bristles on 96 female Drosophila (with technical replicates): bristles-mean.xlsx\n\nThe first three files can be read in with core **tidyerse** functions and the last can be read in with the **readxl** package.\n Load the two packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWe will first read in cat-coats.csv. A .csv. extension suggests this is plain text file with comma separated columns. However, before we attempt to read it it, when should take a look at it. We can do this from RStudio\n Go to the Files pane (bottom right), click on the cat-coats.csv file and choose View File2\n\n\n\nRStudio Files Pane\n\n\nAny plain text file will open in the top left pane (Excel files will launch Excel).\n Is the file csv?\n\n\n What kind of variables does the file contain?\n\n\n Read in the csv file with:\n\ncats &lt;- read_csv(\"cat-coats.csv\")\n\nThe data from the file a read into a dataframe called cats and you will be able to see it in the Environment.\n Click on each of the remaining files and choose View File.\n In each case, say what the format is and what types of variables it contains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use the read_table()3 command to read in plain text files of single columns or where the columns are separated by spaces…\n …so in cell-size.txt can be read into a dataframe called cells like this:\n\ncells &lt;- read_table(\"cell-size.txt\")\n\n Now you try reading bristles.txt in to a dataframe called fly_bristles\nThe **readxl** package we loaded earlier has two useful functions for working with Excel files: excel_sheets(\"filename.xlsx\") will list the sheets in an Excel workbook; read_excel(\"filename.xlsx\") will read in to top sheet or a specified sheet with a small modification read_excel(\"filename.xlsx\", sheet = \"Sheet1\").\n List the the names of the sheets and read in the sheet with the data like this:\n\nexcel_sheets(\"bristles-mean.xlsx\")\nfly_bristles_means &lt;- read_excel(\"bristles-mean.xlsx\", sheet = \"means\")\n\nWell done! You can now read read in from files in your working directory.\nTo help you understand relative file paths, we will now move the data files.\n First remove the dataframes you just created to make it easier to see whether you can successfully read in the files from a different place:\n\nrm(cat_coats, fly_bristles, cells, flies_bristles_means)\n\n Now make a new folder called data-raw. You can do this on the Files Pane by clicking New Folder and typing into the box that appears.\n Check the boxes next to the file names and choose More | Move… and select the data-raw folder.\n The files will move. To import data from files in the data-raw folder, you need to give the relative path to the file from the working directory. The working directory is the Project folder, week-8 so the relative path is data-raw/cat-coats.csv\n Import the cat-coats.csv data like this:\n\ncats &lt;- read_csv(\"data-raw/cat-coats.csv\")\n\n Now you do the other files.\nFrom this point forward in the course, we will always create a data-raw folder each time we make a new Project.\nThese are the most common forms of data file you will encounter at first. However, data can certainly come to you in other formats particularly when they have come from particular software. Usually, there is an R package specially for that format.\nIn the rest of the workshop we will take each dataset in turn and create summaries and plots appropriate for the data types. Data is summarised using the group_by() and summarise() functions"

[^4]: Count data are usually “Poisson” distributed.\n If you want to save the table you created and give the columns better names you can make two adjustments:\n\nfly_bristles_summary &lt;- fly_bristles |&gt; \n  summarise(med = median(number),\n            interquartile = IQR(number))\n\n Plot the bristles data using geom_bar:\nIf counts have a a high mean and big range, like number of hairs on a person’s head, then you can often treat them as continuous. This means you can use statistics like the mean and standard deviation to summarise them, histograms to plot them and use some standard statistical tests on them."

    "text": "Summarising continuous data\n\nCat mass\nThe variable mass in the cats dataframe is continuous. Very many continuous variables have a normal distribution. e normal distribution is also known as the bell-shaped curve. If we had the mass of all the cats in the world, we would find many cats were near the mean and fewer would be away from the mean, either much lighter or much heavier. In fact 68% would be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 96% would be within two standard deviations.\n\n\n\n\n\n We can find the mean mass with:\n\ncats |&gt; \n  summarise(mean = mean(mass))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   mean\n  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  4.51\n\n\nWe can add any sort of summary by placing it inside the the summarise parentheses. Each one is separated by a comma. We did this to find the median and the interquatrile range for fly bristles.\n For example, another way to calculate the number of values is to use the length() function:\n\ncats |&gt; \n  summarise(mean = mean(mass),\n            n = length(mass))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   mean     n\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1  4.51    62\n\n\n Adapt the code to calculate the mean, the sample size and the standard deviation (sd())\nA single continuous variable can be plotted using a histogram to show the shape of the distribution.\n Plots a histogram of cats mass:\n\nggplot(cats, aes(x = mass)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 10, colour = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\nNotice that there are no gaps between the bars which reflects that mass is continuous. bins determines how many groups the variable is divided up into (i.e., the number of bars) and colour sets the colour for the outline of the bars. A sample of 62 is a relatively small number of values for plotting a distribution and the number of bins used determines how smooth or normally distributed the values look.\n Experiment with the number of bins. Does the number of bins affect how you view the distribution.\nNext week we will practice summarise and plotting data files with several variables but just to give you a taste, we will find summary statistics about mass for each of the coat types.  The group_by() function is used before the summarise() to do calculations for each of the coats:\n\ncats |&gt; \n  group_by(coat) |&gt; \n  summarise(mean = mean(mass),\n                  standard_dev = sd(mass))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  coat           mean standard_dev\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 black          4.63        1.33 \n2 calico         2.19       NA    \n3 ginger         4.46        1.12 \n4 tabby          4.86        0.444\n5 tortoiseshell  4.50        0.929\n6 white          4.34        1.34 \n\n\nYou can read this as:\n\ntake cats and then group by coat and then summarise by finding the mean of mass and the standard deviation of mass\n\n Why do we get an NA for the standard deviation of the calico cats?\n\n\n\n\n\nCells\n Summarise the cells dataframe by calculating the mean, median, sample size and standard deviation of FSC.\n Add a column for the standard error which is given by \\(\\frac{s.d.}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\n\n\nMeans of counts\nMany things are quite difficult to measure or count and in these cases we often do technical replicates. A technical replicate allows us the measure the exact same thing to check how variable the measurement process is. For example, Drosophila are small and counting their sternopleural bristles is tricky. In addition, where a bristle is short (young) or broken scientists might vary in whether they count it. Or people or machines might vary in measuring the concentration of the same solution.\nWhen we do technical replicates we calculate their mean and use that as the measure. This is what is in our fly_bristles_means dataframe - the bristles of each of the 96 flies was counted by 5 people and the data are those means. These has an impact on how we plot and summarise the dataset because the distribution of mean counts is continuous! We can use means, standard deviations and histograms. This will be an exercise in Consolidate."
