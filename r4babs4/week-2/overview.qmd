This is the first of the three workshops which are specific to the
Biomedical sciences strand. The aim of these workshops is to teach you
how to analyse the flow cytometry data you will collect in the
practicals. In this workshop, we will guide you through the analysis of
a sample data set just like the one you will generate. Jillian collected
these data in designing this set of practicals. You will learn both how
to analyse the data and what your own data should look like.

### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   explain what is in a flow cytometry data set

-   import `fcs` files, explain a "flowFrame" and a "flowSet" and access
    the column names and data in them

-   apply automated quality control to a flowSet with the **`flowAI`**
    package

-   explain why we use the "logicle" transformation and apply it to
    appropriate channels

-   cast the data into a dataframe to use standard tools for filtering,
    summarising and plotting data

-   explain the purpose of gating and apply appropriate gates to flow
    cytometry data

-   create appropriate summary statistics and figures to demonstrate the
    results of the analysis

### Instructions

1.  [Prepare](study_before_workshop.qmd)

    i.  ðŸ“– Read what the sample data are, what analysis is needed and
        what tools we will use.

2.  [Workshop](workshop.qmd)

    i.ðŸ’» Analyse the sample data set.

3.  [Consolidate](study_after_workshop.qmd)

    i.  ðŸ’» Set up your RStudio Project for the analysis of your own
        data.
