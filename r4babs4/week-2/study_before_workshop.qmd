# Overview

There are three workshops:

1.  Week 2 DA 2: Biomedical sciences - Sample data analysis

2.  Week 4 DA 3: Biomedical sciences - Analysis of your own data

3.  Week 6 DA 4: Biomedical sciences - Customising figures


## Overview

::: incremental
These slides:

-   Prepare you for the sample data analysis workshop; your own data 
    will be like the sample data

-   Summarise the experimental design and aims

-   Explain what the data are

-   Go through the analytical steps conceptually

-   Explain what tools we will use in the workshop to do the analysis

# Experimental design and aims


## Experimental design and aims

::: incremental

-   Macrophages produce TNF-Î± in response to bacterial infection

-   Question: *Does the production of TNF-Î± by macrophages require live bacteria, or is the cell wall component sufficient?*
    
-   Therefore we need 3 treatments: Media (control), Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Cell 
    wall component of *E. coli*) and live *E. coli* 

-   We measure TNF-Î± with a TNF-Î± antibody conjugated to Allophycocyanin (APC)

-   Therefore we need a control for antibody binding and use Isotype antibody

:::


## Experimental design and aims

::: incremental
-   Macrophages are treated with one of three treatments: Media,
    LPS  *E. coli* which are NeonGreen fluorescence

-   Two antibodies are used for each treatment: Isotype antibody, TNF-Î± antibody
    conjugated to Allophycocyanin (APC) 

-   Thus there are 3 x 2 = 6 combinations

-   Two variable of interest: red fluorescence, green fluorescence

-   We also measure forward scatter (cell size) and side scatter 
    (cell granularity) which can be used to quality control the cells
:::



## Experimental design and aims

-   We only expect to see red fluorescence (APC) if the treatment induces TNF-Î± 
production in macrophages *and* the TNF-Î± antibody is used.

-   We only expect to see green fluorescence (FITC) if the treatment is *E. coli*

-   This is summarised in the figure on the next page

# The data

## The data

::: incremental

-   The data are in a flow cytometry standard format (FCS) file

-   Each FCS file contains data from one sample

-   You will have 6 FCS files, one for each combination of treatment
    and antibody
    
-   there are 22 variables in columns and up to 50000 cells in rows
:::


## The data

::: incremental
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   the 22 columns: TIME, Time MSW, Pulse Width,
    FS Lin, FS Area, FS Log, SS Lin, SS Area, SS Log, FL 1 Lin,
    FL 1 Area, FL 1 Log, FL 2 Lin, FL 2 Area, FL 2 Log, FL 3 Lin,
    FL 3 Area, FL 3 Log, FL 8 Lin, FL 8 Area, FL 8 Log, Event Count

-   FS is Forward scatter, SS is Side scatter, FL is fluorescence channel

-   FL 1 is the green fluorescence channel and we will rename it E_coli_FITC

-   FL 8 is the red fluorescence channel and we will rename it TNFa_APC

-   FL 2 and FL 3 are not used in this experiment and we will delete those columns

-   We will use just four columns: E_coli_FITC_Lin, TNFa_APC_Lin,
    FS Lin, and SS Lin

# Analytical steps

## Overview

::: incremental

-   The analysis of flow cytometry data is relatively simple conceptually

-   We apply several quality control steps to the data to remove anomalous 
    signals, dead cells and debris

-   We use scatter plots, calculate means, and find percentages of cells
    in different regions of the scatter plots

:::

## Analytical steps

::: incremental
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Import the data into R, improve the column names and remove unwanted
    columns

-   Apply automated quality control

-   Apply a "logicle" transformation [@parks2006] to the fluorescence channels (similar to logging)

-   Explore the data with scatter plots and histograms/density plots

-   Use FS Lin and SS Lin to determine what cells (rows) to remove as debris

-   Determine cut-offs for cells being positive for TNF-Î± and *E. coli*

-   Calculate the percentage of cells that are positive for TNF-Î± for each treatment

# Tools

## Tools

::: incremental
   
-   Import, rename and subset columns using the **`flowCore`** package [@flowCore]

-   Automated quality control with the **`flowAI`** package [@flowAI]

-   Apply a "logicle" transformation using the **`flowCore`** package

-   Put the data into a dataframe to make it easy to use **`tidyverse`** [@tidyverse] tools like
    `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `ggplot()`, `filter()`

:::


## The data in R

::: incremental

-   the `flowCore` package imports each FCS file as a `flowFrame` object

-   The `flowFrame` object contains the data from the FCS file and
    metadata about the experiment

-   A collection of related `flowFrames` are stored in a `flowSet` object

-   **`flowAI`** and **`flowCore`** functions work with `flowSet` objects

-   After that we can convert the `flowSet` to a dataframe to use
    **`tidyverse`** tools
:::


# Summary

## Summary

-   Sample data are like the data you will produce in your own experiment

-   3 treatments x 2 antibodies = 6 combinations; 4 variables upto 50000 cells each

-   The analysis is conceptually simple: quality control, transformation, scatter plots, 
    and calculating percentages
    
-   The week 2 workshop analyses the sample data, in the week 4 workshop you will 
    analyse your own data
    
-   We will use the **`flowCore`**, **`flowAI`** and **`tidyverse`** packages to do the analysis
