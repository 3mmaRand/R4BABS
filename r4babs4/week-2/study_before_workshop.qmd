# Overview

There are three Biomedical Sciences specific data analysis workshops

1.  Week 2 Step-by-step Analysis of sample data

2.  Week 4 Supported Analysis of your own data

3.  Week 6 Customising figures and considering the Class data

## Overview

::: incremental
These slides:

-   Prepare you for the workshop analysing the sample data....
    and your own data, which is in the same format
    
-   Summarise the experimental design and aims

-   Explain what the data are

-   Go through the analytical steps conceptually

-   Explain what tools we will use in the workshop to do the analysis

# Experimental design and aims

## Experimental design and aims

::: incremental
-   Macrophages produce TNF-Î± in response to bacterial infection

-   Question: *Does the production of TNF-Î± by macrophages require live
    bacteria, or is the cell wall component sufficient?*

-   Therefore we need 3 treatments: Media (control), Lipopolysaccharide
    (LPS, Cell wall component of *E. coli*) and live *E. coli*

-   We measure TNF-Î± with a TNF-Î± antibody conjugated to Allophycocyanin
    (APC) - this will bind and fluoresce red

-   Therefore we also need a control for antibody binding and use 
    Isotype antibody - this will bind but not fluoresce
:::

## Experimental design and aims

::: incremental
-   Macrophages are treated with one of three treatments: Media, LPS or
    NeonGreen fluorescent *E.coli*

-   Two antibodies are used for each treatment: Isotype antibody, TNF-Î±
    antibody conjugated to Allophycocyanin (APC)

-   Thus there are 3 x 2 = 6 combinations (*i.e.,* 6 datasets)

-   Two variables of interest: red fluorescence, green fluorescence

-   We also measure forward scatter (cell size) and side scatter (cell
    granularity) which can be used to quality control the cells
:::

## Experimental design and aims

-   We only expect to see red fluorescence (APC) if the treatment
    induces TNF-Î± production in macrophages *and* the TNF-Î± antibody is
    used.

-   We only expect to see green fluorescence (FITC) if the treatment is
    *E. coli*

-   This is summarised in the figure on the next page

# The data

## The data

::: incremental
-   The data are in a flow cytometry standard format (FCS) file

-   Each FCS file contains data from one sample

-   You will have 6 FCS files, one for each combination of treatment and
    antibody

-   there are 16 variables in columns and up to 50000 cells in rows
:::

## The data

:::: incremental
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   the 16 columns: TIME, Time MSW, Pulse Width, FS Lin, FS Area, FS
    Log, SS Lin, SS Area, SS Log, FL 1 Lin, FL 1 Area, FL 1 Log, 
    FL 8 Lin, FL 8 Area, FL 8 Log, Event Count

-   FS is Forward scatter, SS is Side scatter, FL is fluorescence
    channel

-   FL 1 is the green fluorescence channel and we will rename it
    E_coli_FITC

-   FL 8 is the red fluorescence channel and we will rename it TNFa_APC

-   We will use the Lin columns only

-   We will use just four columns: E_coli_FITC_Lin, TNFa_APC_Lin, FS
    Lin, and SS Lin

# Analytical steps

## Overview

::: incremental
-   The analysis of flow cytometry data is relatively simple
    conceptually

-   We apply several quality control steps to the data to remove
    anomalous signals, dead cells and debris

-   We use scatter plots, calculate means, and find percentages of cells
    in different regions of the scatter plots
:::

## Analytical steps

:::: incremental
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Import the data into R and improve the column names

-   Apply automated quality control

-   Apply a "logicle" transformation [@parks2006] to the fluorescence
    channels (similar to logging)

-   Explore the data with scatter plots and histograms/density plots

-   Use FS Lin and SS Lin to determine what cells (rows) to remove as
    dead/debris

-   Determine cut-offs for cells being positive for TNF-Î± and *E. coli*

-   Calculate the percentage of cells that are positive for TNF-Î± for
    each treatment combination

# Tools

## Tools

::: incremental
-   Import and rename columns using the **`flowCore`** package
    [@flowCore]

-   Automated quality control with the **`flowAI`** package [@flowAI]

-   Apply a "logicle" transformation using the **`flowCore`** package

-   Put the data into a dataframe to make it easy to use **`tidyverse`**
    [@tidyverse] tools like `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `ggplot()`,
    `filter()`
:::

## The data in R

::: incremental
-   the `flowCore` package imports each FCS file as a `flowFrame` object

-   The `flowFrame` object contains the data from the FCS file and
    metadata about the experiment

-   A collection of related `flowFrames` are stored in a `flowSet`
    object

-   **`flowAI`** and **`flowCore`** functions work with `flowSet`
    objects

-   After that we can convert the `flowSet` to a dataframe to use
    **`tidyverse`** tools with which you are more familiar
:::

# Summary

## Summary

-   Sample data are like the data you will produce in your own
    experiment

-   3 treatments x 2 antibodies = 6 combinations; 4 variables upto 50000
    cells each

-   The analysis is conceptually simple: quality control,
    transformation, scatter plots, and calculating percentages

-   The week 2 workshop analyses the sample data, in the week 4 workshop
    you will analyse your own data

-   We will use the **`flowCore`**, **`flowAI`** and **`tidyverse`**
    packages to do the analysis
