# Introduction

This is the last of the four BABS modules and you will draw together many of the elements from the previous BABS modules to perform a guided research project in an area of bioscience related to your degree programme. There will be one core workshop and three workshops specific to your project strand.

This page has the material for the Core workshop and the three Biomedical sciences workshops. All material is on the VLE.

## Module Learning Objectives

The BABS4 Module Learning outcomes that relate to the Data Analysis in R content are:

-   Design the preprocessing, analysis and visualisation of univariate and multivariate data generated with some degree of automation.
Use R to perform these analyses, reproducibly, on data in a variety of formats and present the results graphically

-   Interpret combined experimental results in the context of the wider literature to communicate findings to a scientific audience

# Content

## Week 1 Data Analysis 1: Core

This is taken by all students. The independent study to prepare you for the workshop is revision of some stage 1 core concepts. It covers file types, file systems,  working directories,  paths and RStudio Projects. You may feel completely confident with them but many students will benefit from a refresher. In the workshop we will cover Project organisation, working with data that has many variables and observations, getting an overview with summaries and distribution plots, and how to filter rows and columns.


## Week 2 Data Analysis 2: Biomedical sciences - Sample data analysis

This is the first of the three workshops which are specific to the Biomedical sciences strand. The aim of these workshops is to teach you how to analyse the flow cytometry data you will collect in the practicals. In this workshop, we will guide you through the analysis of a sample data set just like the one you will generate. Jillian collected these data in designing this set of practicals. You will learn both how to analyse the data and what your own data should look like. We will mainly rely on default formats for figures.



## Week 4 Data Analysis 3: Biomedical sciences - Analysis of your own data

In this workshop, you will apply the workflow you learned in the previous workshop to analyse your own data with our support.



## Week 6 Data Analysis 4: Biomedical sciences - Customising figures

In this workshop you will how to customise figures with colour or greyscale, labels, and other features to make them more suitable for publication.
