### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   evaluate their progress and identify any steps they have missed

-   create density plots to visualise the distribution, and gating of,
    the APC TNF-Î± and FTIC signals in live cells

-   calculate the the percentage of cells in each quadrant of a quadrant
    gated plot of TNFa_APC_Lin signal against the E_coli_FITC_Lin 

-   annotate ggplots as desired

-   import data from a googlesheet
