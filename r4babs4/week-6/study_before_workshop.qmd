The independent study allows you to check you have the files you need
having applied the workflow from [Week 2](../week-2/overview.html) to
your own data (or the replacement data if you do not have your own data)
in [Week 4](../week-2/overview.html). However, you will be able to use
files prepared from the sample data for the week 6 workshop if you have
not completed the analysis of your own data.

1.  You should have an RStudio Project with at least: folders for raw
    data, meta data, samples after quality control and processed data, a
    script

2.  You should have processed data files:

    -   `ai_clean_logicle_trans.csv`: Each row is a cell. These are the
        AI cleaned cells with logicle-transformed TNFa_APC_Lin and
        E_coli_FITC_Lin signals. Each cell is labelled with the sample
        (filename) it came from, its treatment and antibody. The cells
        have not been gated -\
        *i.e.*, some of the "cells" in this dataset are dead/debris.
    -   `clean_trans_live_tfna_pos.csv`: Each row is a sample (a
        treatment-antibody combination). For each sample there is: the
        number of cells after AI cleaning, the number of live cells
        after gatting, the percentage of live cells, the number TNF-α
        postive cells, the percentage of TNF-α postive cells and the of
        the mean APC signal in the live cells and TNF-α postive cells
    -   `live_labelled.csv`: Each row is a cell. These are the AI
        cleaned, live cells with logicle-transformed TNFa_APC_Lin and
        E_coli_FITC_Lin signals. Each cell is labelled with the sample
        (filename) it came from, its treatment and antibody, and whether
        it is TNF-α positive (*i.e.* has a TNFa_APC_Lin level above the
        APC cut off used) or negative and whether it is FITC positive
        (*i.e.* E_coli_FITC_Lin level above the FITC cut off used) or
        negative.
    -   you may also have the FITC equivalent of
        `clean_trans_live_tfna_pos.csv`

3.  Enter the values from your analysis to: [BIO00066I Biomedical
    Sciences class
    data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wgQ9goCvYnO44sSHVvP37nFJM12mG8nibdpOOx7ZP9Q/edit?usp=drive_link).
    The column names are the same as those used in the [Data Analysis 2:
    Biomedical sciences - Sample data analysis](../week-2/workshop.html)
    workshop. The columns you must add are marked in green. Other
    information helps you get to the required values and helps others
    determine the reliability of your data. The workshops show how to
    calculate all these values.
