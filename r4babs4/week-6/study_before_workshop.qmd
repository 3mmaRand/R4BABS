The independent study is to check your progress and understanding. We 
have covered the steps listed below. If you have got behind, start 
from wherever you got to.


1.  ðŸ“–  [Read what the sample data are, get an overview of the analysis and tools](../week-2/study_after_workshop.html)


2.  ðŸ’»  [Go through the sample data analysis](../week-2/workshop.html) and make sure you understand the steps and the code
    
    i. You should have a single csv file with data from all 6 samples. 
       The data has been cleaned with **`flowAI`** to remove cells 
       'bad' signals. The file has 19 columns with meaningful names. 
       The TNFa_APC_Lin and E_coli_FITC_Lin columns have been logicle 
       transformed. The file names were added to a column `sample` and 
       columns indicating the treatment and antibody were created 
       by extracting patterns from the file names.  The code that 
       does that relies on the names being in the format 
       Treatment_Antibody. You can import this data as a dataframe 
       and use familiar tidyverse tools. 

    ii. The treatments will be plotted in alphabetical order by 
        default. We can change that order to "MEDIA", "LPS", 
        "ECOLIGreen" using `fct_relevel()`. The code that does that 
        relies on the treatment names being exactly "MEDIA", "LPS", 
        "ECOLIGreen". You can name the treaments differently but
        you will need to change the levels given in `fct_relevel()` 
        accordingly.
       
    iii. You should be able to plot side scatter against forward 
         scatter for the six samples and add a rectangular gate
         for the live cells. You should be able to use this gate
         to filter the data to get a dataframe of live cells.
  
    iv. You should be able calculate the number and percentage of 
        live cells in each sample and annotate the figure in iii. 
        with those percentages. These were in a dataframe I named
        `clean_trans_nondebris_n`.
        
    v.  You should be able to plot the logicle transformed 
        TNFa_APC_Lin against the E_coli_FITC_Lin for the live 
        cells and add a gate for the TNF-Î± positive 
        cells and label the rows (cells) in the dataframe as 
        TNF-Î± positive or TNF-Î± negative. You should be able to 
        calculate the number and percentage of of TNF-Î± positive 
        cells in each sample. These were in a dataframe I named 
        `clean_trans_nondebris_tfna_pos` 
    
    vi. You should be able add a gate for the FITC positive 
        cells and label the rows (cells) in the dataframe as 
        FITC positive or FITC negative. You should be able to 
        calculate the number and percentage of FITC positive cells 
        in each sample using the same logic as in v.

3.  ðŸ’»  Prepare to analyse your own data / the model data

    i.  [Make a new RStudio Project, copy in the script and tidy it up](../week-2/study_after_workshop.html)
    
    ii.  [Save your data](../week-2/study_after_workshop.html). Your data are on [googledrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16OBb5ABVBd6ZxKf8uG7lPTx6cSNLvisT). If you do not have any data you can use the Flow cytometry MODEL DATA

4.  ðŸ’»  [Analyse your own data / the model data](../week-4/workshop.html)
    
    i.  Make your life easier renaming your data files to match the 
        sample data.
        
    ii.  Note that your data has 16 columns. You need a different
         metadata file than used for the sample data. You will not 
         need to [Drop the unused channels](../week-2/workshop.html#drop-the-unused-channels-columns)


5.  ðŸ’»  Enter data from your analysis in to [BIO00066I Biomedical Sciences class data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/104EXdgsiIq-FuRF9Ly9zewEVdpkVWbyOwxSAmiqJepg/edit#gid=0)

    The columns you must add are:
    
    -   `apc_mfi`:	Mean fluorescence intensity of the logicle 
         transformed TNFa_APC_Lin in the TNF-Î± positive cells
    
    -   `perc_tfna_pos`:	% non debris cells that are TNF-Î± 
         positive cells   
    
    The other columns are calculations you make along the 
    way and may help you get to the `apc_mfi` and `perc_tfna_pos`
    values. The column names are the same as those used in the
