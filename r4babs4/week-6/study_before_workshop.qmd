The independent study allows you to check you have the files you need
having applied the workflow from [Week 2](../week-2/overview.html) to 
your own data (or the replacement data if you do not have your own 
data) in [Week 4](../week-2/overview.html). However, you will be able
to use files prepared from the sample data for the week 6 workshop if
you have not completed week 4.


1.  You should have an RStudio Project with at least: folders for 
    raw data, meta data, samples after quality control and processed 
    data, a script

2.  You should have processed data files:

    -   `ai_clean_logicle_trans.csv`: Each row is a cell. These are the 
         AI cleaned cells with logicle-transformed TNFa_APC_Lin
         and E_coli_FITC_Lin signals. Each cell is 
         labelled with the sample (filename) it came from, its 
         treatment and antibody. The cells have not been gated -  
         *i.e.*, some of the "cells" in this dataset are
         dead/debris.
    -   `clean_trans_live_tfna_pos.csv`: Each row is a sample (a
         treatment-antibody combination). For each sample there is: 
         the number of cells after AI cleaning, the number of live 
         cells after gatting, the percentage of live cells, the number 
         TNF-α postive cells, the percentage of TNF-α postive cells and
         the of the mean APC signal in the live cells and TNF-α postive
         cells
    -   `live_labelled.csv`: Each row is a cell. These are the AI 
         cleaned, live cells with logicle-transformed TNFa_APC_Lin
         and E_coli_FITC_Lin signals. Each cell is 
         labelled with the sample (filename) it came from, its 
         treatment and antibody, and whether it is TNF-α positive
         (*i.e.* has a TNFa_APC_Lin level above the APC cut off used)
         or negative and whether it is FITC positive
         (*i.e.* E_coli_FITC_Lin level above the FITC cut off
         used) or negative.
    -    you may also have the FITC equivalent of
         `clean_trans_live_tfna_pos.csv`
         
3.  Enter the values from your analysis to: 
    [BIO00066I Biomedical Sciences class data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wgQ9goCvYnO44sSHVvP37nFJM12mG8nibdpOOx7ZP9Q/edit?usp=drive_link). The column names are the same as those 
    used in the [Data Analysis 2: Biomedical sciences - Sample data analysis](../week-2/workshop.html) workshop. The columns you must add
    are marked in green. Other information helps you get to the 
    required values and helps others determine the reliability of your 
    data. The workshops show how to calculate all these values.
