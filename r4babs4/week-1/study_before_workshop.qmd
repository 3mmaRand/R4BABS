1.  ðŸ“– Read [Understanding file
    systems](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/file_systems.html).
    Approximately 15 - 20 minutes. This is revision of some stage 1 core
    concepts. It covers file types, filesystems. working directories and
    paths. You may feel completely confident with them but many students
    will benefit from a refresher.

2.  ðŸ“– Read [RStudio
    Projects](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/workflow_rstudio.html#rstudio-projects).
    Section 7.1 only. Approximately 5 - 10 minutes. This is revision but
    part of the assessment requires that you use an RStudio project so
    if you aren't sure you are using them, you might want to check.

Entirely optionally, you might want to review some other stage 1
content. You can access these through the past VLE sites but you might
find it helpful to use my latest versions because I have improved them,
there is no 2FA and the sites are searchable.

Stage 1

-   [Data Analysis in R for Becoming a Bioscientist
    1](../../r4babs1/r4babs1.html).Core concepts about scientific
    computing, types of variable, the role of variables in analysis and
    how to use RStudio to organise analysis and import, summarise and
    plot data.

-   [Data Analysis in R for Becoming a Bioscientist
    2](../../r4babs2/r4babs2.html). The logic of hypothesis testing,
    confidence intervals, what is meant by a statistical model,
    two-sample tests and one- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
