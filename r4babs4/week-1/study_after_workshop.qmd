1.  ðŸ’» Set up the Virtual Desktop

    I very strongly recommend working on the University computers for
    this work. You will be using more specialised R packages than you
    might be used to. This is especially important if you often have
    difficulty updating and or installing software on your own machine,
    wouldn't know what what version of R you are using or don't realise
    there is a difference between R and RStudio. The uni machines always
    have up-to-date R and R packages and all the packages that appear in
    teaching materials. It is our responsibility to ensure everything
    works on here.

    You can still work from home by using the [Virtual Desktop
    Service](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/tools/vds/). The VDS
    allows you to log on to a university computer from your own
    computer. It means you can access all software and filestores. When
    using the VDS for R and RStudio, it usually makes sense to use other
    software - such as a browser or file explorer - also through the
    VDS.

    If you are confident in your ability to set up your own machine, you
    need:

    -   to know the difference between R and RStudio
    -   to use R 4.4 and RStudio 2024.09.0 Build 375 ("Cranberry
        Hibiscus")
    -   be certain you are actually using R 4.4 - it is written in the
        top edge of the console window. By default RStudio uses the
        latest version on R on your machine. However, windows users are
        able to change this to a "specific version". You might have done
        that previously. Change it back using Tools \| Global Options R
        version "Use your machine's default 64-bit version of R"
    -   to make sure you do the independent study where it tells you
        what steps you need to take to get packages (and versions that
        are unlikely to cause issues) used in the workshop

    It is possible to access all your files on your university account
    without using the VDS. For example, if you want to work on uni
    machines at uni and your machine at home. You can best do this by
    mapping a drive:
    https://support.york.ac.uk/s/topic/0TO4K000000lA5ZWAU/filestores. If
    you store everything on google drive you can also read/write to that
    like any other drive using google drive app.

    Even if you plan to use your own machine I really recommend you take
    the time to set the VDS up now while you're not time pressured so 
    you always have that option ready.
