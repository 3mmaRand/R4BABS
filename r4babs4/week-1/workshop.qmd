## Philosophy

Workshops are not a test. It is expected that you often don't know how to start, make a lot of mistakes and need help. It is expected that you are familiar with independent study content before the workshop. However, you need not remember or understand every detail as the workshop should build and consolidate your understanding. Tips

-   don't worry about making mistakes
-   don't let what you can not do interfere with what you can do
-   discussing code with your neighbours will help
-   look things up in the independent study material
-   look things up in your own code from earlier
-   there are no stupid questions

## Key

These four symbols are used at the beginning of each instruction so you know where to carry out the instruction.

![](images/do_on_your_computer.png) Something you need to do on your computer. It may be opening programs or documents or locating a file.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Something you should do in RStudio. It will often be typing a command or using the menus but might also be creating folders, locating or moving files.

![](images/do_on_internet.png) Something you should do in your browser on the internet. It may be searching for information, going to the VLE or downloading a file.

![](images/answer.png) A question for you to think about and answer. Record your answers  for future reference.

## Reproducibility

### Why does it matter?

![futureself, CC-BY-NC, by Julen
Colomb](images/future_you.png){fig-alt="Person working at a computer with an offstage person asking 'How is the analysis going?' The person at the computer replies 'Can't understand the date...and the data collector does not answer my emails or calls' Person offstage: 'That's terrible! So cruel! Who did collect the data? I will sack them!' Person at the computer: 'um...I did, 3 years ago.'"

-   Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly [@markowetz2015].
    Alternatively, see the very entertaining
    [talk](https://youtu.be/yVT07Sukv9Q) which covers the the "Duke Scandal".

-   Many high profile cases of work which did not reproduce e.g. Anil
    Potti's work unravelled by @baggerly2009 in the "Duke Scandal"

-   **Will** become standard in Science and publishing e.g OECD Global
    Science Forum Building digital workforce capacity and skills for
    data-intensive science [@oecdglobalscienceforum2020]

### How to achieve reproducibility

-   Scripting

-   Organisation: Project-oriented workflows with file and folder
    structure, naming things

-   Documentation: Comment your code. 



### Project-oriented workflow

-   use folders to organise your work

-   you are aiming for structured, systematic and repeatable.

-   inputs and outputs should be clearly identifiable from structure
    and/or naming

Example

```         
-- stem-cells
   |__stem-cells.Rproj
   |__analysis.R
   |__data-raw
      |__2019-03-21_donor_1.csv
      |__2019-03-21_donor_2.csv
      |__2019-03-21_donor_3.csv
   |__figures
      |__01_volcano_donor_1_vs_donor_2.png
      |__02_volcano_donor_1_vs_donor_3.png
```

## Naming things

-   machine readable

-   human readable

-   play nicely with sorting

I suggest

-   no spaces in names

-   use snake_case or kebab-case rather than CamelCase or dot.case

-   use all lower case 

-   ordering: use left-padded numbers e.g., 01, 02....99 or 001,
    002....999

-   dates [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:
    2020-10-16

# Exercises

## Getting started


![](images/do_on_your_computer.png) Start RStudio from the Start menu.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Go the Files tab in the lower right pane and click on the `...` on the right. This will open a "Go to folder" window. Navigate to a place on your computer where you keep your work. Click Open.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Also on the Files tab click on `New Folder`. Type "data-analysis-in-r-4" in to the box. This will be the folder that we work in throughout the Data Analysis in R part BABS4.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Make an RStudio project for this workshop by clicking on the drop-down menu on top right where it says `Project: (None)` and choosing New Project, then New Directory, then New Project. Name the RStudio Project 'core-01'.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Make a new script then save it with a name like analysis.R to carry out the rest of the work.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Add a comment to the script: `# Core` and load the **`tidyverse`** [@tidyverse] package

![](images/do_in_R.png) Make a new folder called `data-raw`.

# Independent study following the workshop

[Consolidate](study_after_workshop.qmd)

# The Code file

This contains all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not visible on the webpage.

The `workshop.qmd` file is the file I use to compile the practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary text to be interweaved to produce well-formatted reports including webpages. [View the Qmd in Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/R4BABS/blob/main/r4babs4/week-1/workshop.qmd). Coding and thinking answers are marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`

Pages made with R [@R-core], Quarto [@allaire2022], `knitr` [@knitr], `kableExtra` [@kableExtra]
