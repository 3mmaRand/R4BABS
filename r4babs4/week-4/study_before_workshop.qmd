1.  ðŸ’» Open the RStudio Project you created in the [Consolidation
    exercise from week 2](../week-2/study_after_workshop.html).

2.  ðŸ’» Save your data files to that project. Are the file names going to 
    be easy for you to work with? 
    [Remember](../week-2/workshop.html#make-data-easier-to-work-with) 
    that we used the file names to label to rows with their treatment 
    (Media, LPS or ECOLIGreen) and antibody (ISOTYPE or TNFAPC) so if 
    you do not match the names you will need to redesign the code to 
    appropriately. It is easier to rename your files!

3.  ðŸ“–  Go through the script and identify the parts that you will need
    to change to make it work for your data.

4.  ðŸ“–  Can you identify code that you will not need to include?

5.  ðŸ“– Go through the [Week 2 Workshop](../week-2/workshop.html) and 
     read the text to check you understand what is happening to the 
     data.

6.  ðŸ’» Consider importing and analysing your own data so that you
    can make good use of the workshop to resolve any issues you
    encounter.
