# The Code file

This contains all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not visible on the webpage.

The `workshop.qmd` file is the file I use to compile the practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary text to be interweaved to produce well-formatted reports including webpages. [View the Qmd in Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/R4BABS/blob/main/r4babs4/week-4/workshop.qmd). Coding and thinking answers are marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`

Pages made with R [@R-core], Quarto [@allaire2022], `knitr` [@knitr], `kableExtra` [@kableExtra]
