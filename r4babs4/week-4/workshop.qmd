# Introduction

In this workshop you will use the tools you used in the previous workshop (and before!) to analyse the data you have collected. You will provide some key pieces of information for the class data set. 

# Exercises

## Getting started on your own analysis

ðŸŽ¬ Open the RStudio Project you created in the [Consolidation exercise from week 2](../week-2/study_after_workshop.html).

ðŸŽ¬ If you have not already done so, save your data files to the project. Are the file names going to be easy for you to work with? If not, rename them.

ðŸŽ¬ Open your R script and begin to analyse your data.



## Data for the class dataset.

You need to provide the following information for the class dataset:

-   group_name:	A name for your group. Take care not to use a name used by others. Take care to use the exactly the same name for each of your rows

-   cell_treatment:	One of MEDIA, LPS or ECOLIGreen

-   antibody:	One of ISOTYPE or TNFAPC

-   n_cells:	number of cells in sample after flowAI cleaning

-   n_cells_live:	number of cells in sample after flowAI cleaning and removing debris

-   perc_nondebris:	% "cleaned" cells that were not debris

-   apc_cut:	threshold for logicle transformed TNFa_APC_Lin. This will be the same for all your samples

-   apc_mfi:	Mean fluorescence intensity of the logicle transformed TNFa_APC_Lin in the TNF-Î± positive cells

-   n_pos_tnfa:	Number of TNF-Î± positive cells

-   perc_tfna_pos:	% non debris cells that are TNF-Î± positive cells    

Enter these in the [BIO00066I Biomedical Sciences class data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/104EXdgsiIq-FuRF9Ly9zewEVdpkVWbyOwxSAmiqJepg/edit#gid=0)


## How to change the name of an RStudio project.

You may need to rename your RStudio Project to your exam number before you submit. You can change the name of an RStudio project by:

-   closing the project

-   renaming both the project folder and the `.Rproj` file.



# Independent study following the workshop

[Consolidate](study_after_workshop.qmd)

# The Code file

This contains all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not visible on the webpage.

The `workshop.qmd` file is the file I use to compile the practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary text to be interweaved to produce well-formatted reports including webpages. [View the Qmd in Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/R4BABS/blob/main/r4babs4/week-4/workshop.qmd). Coding and thinking answers are marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`

Pages made with R [@R-core], Quarto [@allaire2022], `knitr` [@knitr], `kableExtra` [@kableExtra]
