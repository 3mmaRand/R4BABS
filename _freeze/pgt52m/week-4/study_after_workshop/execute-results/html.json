The variables in the dataset are:\n\n    -   sodium  - Sodium concentration in umol/L, the average of 5 technical \n        replicates\n    -   potassium - Potassium concentration in umol/L, the average of 5\n        technical replicates\n    -   B12 Vitamin - B12 in pmol/L, the average of 5 technical replicates\n    -   wbc - White blood cell count in 10^9 /L, the average of 5 technical \n        replicates\n    -   rbc count - Red blood cell count in\t10^12 /L, the average of 5 \n        technical replicates\n    -   platlet count - platlet count in\t10^9 /L, the average of 5 technical\n        replicates\n    -   inflammation marker - the presence or absence of a marker of \n        inflammation, either 0 or 1 \n    -   status - whether the individual is before or after treatment.\n\n\n\n    Your task is to summarise and plot these data in any suitable way. Create a \n    complete RStudio Project for an analysis of these data. You will need to:\n\n    -   Make a new project \n    -   Make folders for data and for figures\n    -   Import the data\n    -   Summarise and plot variables of your choice. It doesn't matter what \n        you chose - the goal is the practice the project workflow and selecting\n        appropriate plotting and summarising methods for particular data sets.",
