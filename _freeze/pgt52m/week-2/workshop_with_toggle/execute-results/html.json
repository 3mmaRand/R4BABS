A welcome mat says 'Welcome'.\"\nwidth=\"800\"}\n\n## Session overview\n\nIn this workshop you will use RStudio to write R code. You will type in\nsome data, plot it and then customise your plot.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nWorkshops are not a test. It is expected that you often don't know how\nto start, make a lot of mistakes and need help. It is expected that you\nare familiar with independent study content before the workshop.\nHowever, you need not remember or understand every detail as the\nworkshop should build and consolidate your understanding. Tips\n\n-   don't worry about making mistakes\n-   don't let what you can not do interfere with what you can do\n-   discussing code with your neighbours will help\n-   look things up in the independent study material\n-   look things up in your own code from earlier workshops\n-   there are no stupid questions\n\n::: callout-note\n## Key\n\nThese four symbols are used at the beginning of each instruction so you\nknow where to carry out the instruction.\n\n![](images/do_on_your_computer.png) Something you need to do on your\ncomputer. It may be opening programs or documents or locating a file.\n\n![](images/do_in_R.png) Something you should do in RStudio. It will\noften be typing a command or using the menus but might also be creating\nfolders, locating or moving files.\n\n![](images/do_on_internet.png) Something you should do in your browser\non the internet. It may be searching for information, going to the VLE\nor downloading a file.\n\n![](images/answer.png) A question for you to think about and answer.\nRecord your answers in your script for future reference.\n:::\n\n# Getting started\n\n![](images/do_on_your_computer.png) Start RStudio from the Start menu.\n\n![](images/do_in_R.png) Go the Files tab in the lower right pane and\nclick on the `...` on the right. This will open a \"Go to folder\" window.\nNavigate to a place on your computer where you keep your work. Click\nOpen.\n\n![](images/do_in_R.png) Also on the Files tab click on `New Folder`.\nType \"data-analysis-in-r-1\" in to the box. This will be the folder that\nwe work in throughout.\n\n![](images/do_in_R.png) Make an RStudio project for this workshop by\nclicking on the drop-down menu on top right where it says\n`Project: (None)` and choosing New Project, then New Directory, then New\nProject. Name the RStudio Project 'week-2'.\n\n![](images/do_in_R.png) Make a new script then save it with a name like\nanalysis.R to carry out the rest of the work.\n\n![](images/do_in_R.png) Add a comment to the script:\n`# Introduction to RStudio and your first graph`\n\n# Exercises\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>üêà Coat colour of cats Example</summary>\n\n### The goal\n\nWe will work with some data on the coat colour of 62 cats.
