# 💚💻 Week 5 26C Data Analysis in R for BABS 2

🐌 Hello Everyone,

We are in week 4 and this email is about *week 5*.

## 5️⃣ What is happening in week 5

So far you have learnt how to use and interpret the general linear model
when:

-   the *x* variable was continuous
-   the *x* variable was categorical with two groups
-   the *x* variable was categorical with two or more groups

This week we will extend of our understanding by learning how to include
*two* categorical explanatory variables in a general linear model. This
model is often known as the two-way ANOVA. It allows us to design
experiments to test whether a response is influenced by two variables
*and* whether those two variables act independently on the response or
interact in some way. These are often the most interesting biological
findings!

The materials are on the VLE: Week 5 Data Analysis in R (or [Week 5
without
2FA](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-5/overview.html)).
There is:

-   An overview of the week.

-   Some independent study to
    [Prepare!](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-5/study_before_workshop.html)
    for the workshop. It covers the ideas behind two-way ANOVA using an
    example about periwinkles (a marine snail).

-   The
    [workshop](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-5/workshop.html)
    in which you will test whether there is an effect of brain region
    and choline deficiency on neuron size

-   And some independent study for after the workshop to
    [Consolidate](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-5/study_after_workshop.html)
    what you are learning.

Bests,
