# 💚💻 Week 3 26C Data Analysis in R for BABS 2

🐦 Hello Everyone,

We are in week 2 and this email is about *week 3*.

## 3️⃣ What is happening in week 3

This week you will use many of same concepts and bits of code as you did
last week. You will learn how to use and the general linear model when
the explanatory (or x) variable is categorical with two possible values.
These tests are also known as *t*-tests. You will also find out about
independent- and dependent- (also known as paired-) samples and
"non-parametric tests" which we use when the assumptions of the general
linear model are not met.

The materials are on the VLE: Week 3 Data Analysis in R (or [Week 3
without
2FA](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-3/overview.html)).
There is:

-   An overview of the week.

-   Some independent study to
    [Prepare!](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-3/study_before_workshop.html)
    for the workshop. It covers the ideas behind two-sample tests using
    an example about [common
    chaffinch, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_chaffinch)*Fringilla
    coelebs.*

-   The
    [workshop](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-3/workshop.html)
    in which you will get practice in choosing between, performing, and
    presenting the results of, two-sample tests and their non-parametric
    equivalents in R. You'll learn to annotate graphs with results.

Bests,
