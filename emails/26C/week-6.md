# 🧡💻 BIO00027C-Week 6: Data Analysis in R for BABS 1

👋 Hello Everyone, I am writing about the Data Analysis in R part of
BABS 1 which begins in Week 6.

## 🧑‍💻 About Data Analysis in R

You can read an overview of Data Analysis in R in your degree, and in
BABS 1 on the VLE. The material is also available without 2FA [Overview
in degree](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/) and [Overview in BABS
1](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/r4babs1.html).

## 📋 Organisation of the teaching

In each week there is

-   ℹ️ An overview on the “About” page which gives the Learning
    Objectives, a summary and instructions. You should read this first.
-   📖 Some independent study of about 30-45 minutes on the “Prepare!”
    page to get ready for the workshop
-   🖥️A two-hour workshop using R. This will usually start with me doing
    a short demonstration but you will spend most of the session trying
    things out yourself. There will be plenty of help from me and my
    demonstrators.
-   💻 Some independent study of about 30-45 minutes on the
    “Consolidate!” page to give you more practice. I will send an email
    on Monday each week about the following week's material. Expect an
    email on Monday of week 6 about week 7.

## 6️⃣ What is happening in week 6

The week 6 materials are on the VLE: Week 6 Data Analysis in R (or [Week
6 without
2FA](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-6/overview.html)).

The key points about week 6 are:

-   there is some reading to do about [computer file systems and
    definitions for R and
    RStudio](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-6/study_before_workshop.html)
-   there is no formal workshop but you should set up the [Virtual
    Desktop
    Service](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-6/workshop.html)
    so you can easily code at home.
-   There is an online "lecture" (Intro: Data Handling - BIO00027C) on
    your timetable for Wednesday, 5 November⋅10:00 – 11:00. The main
    purpose of this session is to talk over the organisation and give
    you an opportunity to ask questions.

🤸 I really enjoy teaching this module so I'm looking forward to working
with you after the consolidation week.

I do like an emoji!

Bests, Emma
