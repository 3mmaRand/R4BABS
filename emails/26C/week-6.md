# 💚💻 Week 6 26C Data Analysis in R for BABS 2

Hello Everyone,

We are in week 5 and this email is about *week 6*.

🎉🥳🪅 Congratulations! You've made it to the final week of stage 1 Data
Analysis in R!

## 6️⃣ What is happening in week 6

Up to this point, we have focused on methods that examine how one
variable affects another. This week we shift our focus to situations
where no causal relationship is assumed. Instead of asking whether one
variable predicts another, we ask whether two variables are associated -
whether they tend to change together. You will learn how to test whether
there is an association between two categorical variables using the
chi-squared contingency test and how to test whether there is an
association between two continuous variables using the correlation test.

The materials are on the VLE: Week 6 Data Analysis in R (or [Week 6
without
2FA](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-6/overview.html)).
There is:

-   An overview of the week.

-   Some independent study to
    [Prepare!](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-6/study_before_workshop.html)
    for the workshop. It covers the ideas behind correlation and the
    chi-squared contingency test. There is an example about how systolic
    blood pressure (SBP) is associated with kidney function and one
    about what pigs like eating

-   The
    [workshop](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-6/workshop.html)
    in which you will get practice in choosing and applying parametric
    and non-parametric correlations and doing chi-squared contingency
    tests.

-   And some independent study for after the workshop to

    what you are learning.

Bests,
