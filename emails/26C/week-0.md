# 💚💻 BIO00026C Data Analysis in R for BABS 2

👋 Hello Everyone,

I am writing about the Data Analysis in R part of BABS 2 which begins in
Week 1.

Over six weeks you will learn about the logic of hypothesis testing,
confidence intervals, what is meant by a statistical model, two-sample
tests and one- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

R for BABS2 is part of BABS2 which also includes lab work, tutorials and
grand challenges! Module organiser, Dr Adrian Harrison, will give a
comprehensive introduction to the module and how the parts fit together
on Tuesday, 10 February.

TL,DR:

-   💚💻R for BABS2 is organised like 🧡💻R for BABS1
-   Email coming on Wednesday about week 1
-   Here's a suggested minimal catch-up for 🧡💻R for BABS1!
-   My fondness for emojis is undiminished

## 📋 R for BABS2 is organised just like R for BABS1

Meaning that:

-   📚 All materials are available on the VLE and without 2FA at [Data
    Analysis in R for BABS
    2](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/r4babs2.html)
-   🏫 Each week there is
    -   ℹ️ An overview on the “About” page which gives the Learning
        Objectives, a summary and instructions. You should read this
        first.
    -   📖 Some independent study of about 30-45 minutes on the
        “Prepare!” page to get ready for the workshop
    -   🖥️A two-hour workshop using R. This will usually start with me
        doing a short demonstration but you will spend most of the
        session trying things out yourself. There will be plenty of help
        from me and my demonstrators.
    -   💻 Some independent study of about 30-45 minutes on the
        “Consolidate!” page to give you more practice.
-   I will send an email at 0800 Wednesday each week about the
    *following week's material.* Expect an email on Wednesday of this
    week about week 1.
-   All the answers (coding and thinking) are in the source code for the
    workshop. You can view it using the `</> Code` button at the top of
    the workshop. Coding and thinking answers are marked with
    `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`

You can read an overview of [Data Analysis in R in your
degree](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/), and in
[BABS2](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/r4babs2.html).

## Help! I'm not sure about things in 🧡💻R for BABS1!

There will be people reading who missed workshops in semester 1 or who
want a refresher. If you mostly kept up but feel rusty now you can
probably just go though the materials as we did last semester trying out
things you have forgotten and skipping things where you feel more
confident.

If you missed most of the workshops or feel very behind this is the plan
I suggest. It focusses on the
[book](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/) and some of the
demonstrations I did at the start of workshops. I haven't included the
workshops so you won't get lots of practice but this list gives you good
bang-for-your-buck. You'll learn most of the ideas - without having to
solve workshop problems - in the shortest time.

1.  The most important thing to remember is that any progress, no matter
    how small, is better than none. It

    is always ok to be working on material from R for BABS1 in the R for
    BABS 2 workshops.

2.  Set up the [Virtual desktop
    service](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-6/workshop.html)
    so you can log into a university computer from any where. This means
    you won't have to install R and RStudio or any packages.
    Alternatively any time this week it should be easy to find a
    computer in the library, Biology R012 or anywhere else on campus

3.  You might want to look at the [questions and
    answers](menti%20questions%20and%20answers) from a menti in session
    introducing R for BABS1

4.  Read [What they forgot to teach you about
    computers](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/what-they-forgot.html) in [Computational
    Analysis for Bioscientists](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/)

5.  Read [What are R and
    Rstudio?](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/about-R-and-RStudio.html)

6.  Watch [Getting started with
    Rstudio](https://youtu.be/7oLLjkTNrjY?si=VQZ3LDnyR367qYDj) and [Data
    Structures and
    functions](youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=2Ke1FGdaMSI&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2F3mmarand.github.io%2F&source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjg2NjY).
    Or Read [Introduction to
    RStudio](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/about-R-and-RStudio.html#introduction-to-rstudio)
    and [First Steps in
    RStudio](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/first-steps-rstudio.html)
    if you prefer written material.

7.  Read [Workflow in
    RStudio](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/workflow-rstudio.html)

8.  Watch the demonstration at the start of the [Semester 1 week 7
    workshop](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=fab41c28-1e28-4143-bfee-b38b00adc909)
    (this was the first workshop). It summarises the organisation of the
    materials, some of the ideas covered in the reading/watching above
    but also demonstrates changing the RStudio settings, and talks more
    about paths, shows project set up and so on. It might also help you
    decide if you would find it useful to do the workshop. Sorry -
    you'll have to log into the VLE to access that panopto link.

9.  Read [Understanding the
    pipe `|>`](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/workflow-rstudio.html#understanding-the-pipe)

10. Read [Ideas about
    data](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/ideas-about-data.html)

11. Read [From importing to
    reporting](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/import-to-report.html).

12. Watch the demonstration at the start of the [Semester 1 week 8
    workshop](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9a511efe-b87b-45e1-9e7a-b39300ad6001)
    (this was the second workshop). It summarises some of the ideas
    covered in the reading/watching above but also demonstrates project
    set up and data import and discusses working directories and paths.
    Again, you'll have to log into the VLE to access that panopto link.

See you in Week 1,

Emma
