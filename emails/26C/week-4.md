# 💚💻 Week 4 26C Data Analysis in R for BABS 2

Hello Everyone,

We are in week 3 and this email is about *week 4*.

## 4️⃣ What is happening in week

Last week you learnt how to use and interpret the general linear model
when the *x* variable was categorical with two groups. You will now
extend that to situations when there are more than two groups. This is
often known as the one-way ANOVA (**an**alysis **o**f **va**riance). You
will also learn about the Kruskal-Wallis test which can be used when the
assumptions of the general linear model are not met.

The materials are on the VLE: Week 4 Data Analysis in R (or [Week 4
without
2FA](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-4/overview.html)).
There is:

-   An overview of the week.

-   Some independent study to
    [Prepare!](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-4/study_before_workshop.html)
    for the workshop. It covers the ideas behind one-way ANOVA and
    Kruskal-Wallis using an example about growing bacterial colonies on
    different media

-   The
    [workshop](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-4/workshop.html)
    in which you will get practice in choosing between, performing, and
    presenting the results of, one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis in R.
    You will meet the seals again! Baby Weddell seals are insanely cute!
