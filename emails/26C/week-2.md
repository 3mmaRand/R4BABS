# 💚💻 Week 2 26C Data Analysis in R for BABS 2

🌱 Hello Everyone,

We are in week 1 and this email is about *week 2*.

## 2️⃣ What is happening in week 2

This week is big on concepts! Most people won't understand all of them
this week and that's completely fine - you'll be working with these
concepts over the next few weeks and the understanding will build
gradually. You’ll learn about statistical *models*, which are
mathematical representations of data relationships. Specifically, you’ll
explore the *general linear model (GLM)*, a broad framework for
analyzing data patterns.

Your first GLM will be *simple linear regression*, which fits a straight
line to data to predict a *response variable* (outcome) based on
an *explanatory variable* (predictor). We’ll examine the two
key *parameters* estimated in this model: the *slope* (which shows how
the predictor influences the outcome) and the *intercept* (the value
when the predictor is zero). We’ll also assess whether these values are
significantly different from zero.

The materials are on the VLE: Week 2 Data Analysis in R (or [Week 2
without 2FA](#0){style="font-size: 9pt;"}). There is:

-   An overview of the week.

-   Some independent study to
    [Prepare!](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-2/study_before_workshop.html)
    for the workshop. It covers what a statistical model is and the
    terminology we use, how we check their assumptions and how we report
    them. It also covers linear regression ![The a linear model fitted
    to the relationship between temperature and respiration rate. The
    model has two coefficients (parameters) estimated from the data. The
    first estimate is the intercept and the second estimate is the
    slope.](linear-model.png){fig-alt="The a linear model fitted to the relationship between temperature and respiration rate. The model has two coefficients (parameters) estimated from the data. The first estimate is the intercept and the second estimate is the slope."

-   The
    [workshop](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-2/workshop.html)
    in which you will carry out, interpret and report a single linear
    regression.

-   And some independent study for after the workshop to
    [Consolidate](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-2/study_after_workshop.html)
    what you are learning.

## 🆘 Help! I'm way behind!

I want to reiterate that, if you feel behind, please come to the
workshops and work on material from BABS1. It is never too late to make
a start and it is definitely better to make a little progress from the
start than to scare yourself trying to do the latest material. Start
from where you are! You won't be the only one.

Bests,

Emma
