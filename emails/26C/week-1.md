# 💚💻 Week 1 26C Data Analysis in R for BABS 2

🐝 Hello Everyone,

We are in week 0 and this email is about *week 1*.

## 1️⃣ What is happening in week 1

Week 1 is about the logic of hypothesis testing, sampling distributions,
the standard error and confidence intervals. The materials are on the
VLE: Week 1 Data Analysis in R (or [Week 1 without
2FA](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-1/overview.html)).
There is:

-   An overview of the week.
-   Some independent study to
    [Prepare!](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-1/study_before_workshop.html)
    for the workshop. It covers Hypothesis testing, samples and
    populations, Type I and Type II errors, the sampling distribution of
    the mean and the standard error. It also gives the background to
    confidence intervals
-   The\
    [workshop](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-1/workshop.html)
    in which you will remind yourself how to import files before getting
    practice calculating confidence intervals on large and small
    samples. You will also learn how to create a zip file - this is what
    you will submit for the assessment!
-   And some independent study for after the workshop to
    [Consolidate](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/week-1/study_after_workshop.html)
    what you are learning.

No 🐈 but some 🐝 and some 🐀🧠

Bests,
