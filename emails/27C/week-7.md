# 🧡💻 BIO00027C-Week 7: Data Analysis in R for BABS 1

🌊 Hello Everyone,

We are in week 6 and this email about *week 7*.

## 7️⃣ What is happening in week 7

Week 7 is an Introduction to R and RStudio and organising your work. The
materials are on the VLE: Week 7 Data Analysis in R (or [Week 7 without
2FA](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-7/overview.html)).
There is:

-   An overview of the week.
-   Some independent study to
    [Prepare!](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-7/study_before_workshop.html)
    for the workshop. It is important that you do this before trying the
    workshop material so as not to scare yourself too much. You can
    either watch two videos ( \~40 mins at normal speed) *OR* read the
    same content. You will learn about data types such as "numerics" and
    "characters" and some of the different types of objects in R such as
    "vectors" and "dataframes". These are the building blocks for the
    rest of your R journey.
-   The
    [workshop](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-7/workshop.html)
    where you will start writing R code in RStudio and will create your
    first graph

I am not sure why I didn't include grey as a colour because I have a
grey cat called Boo:

-   And some independent study for after the workshop to
    [Consolidate](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-7/study_after_workshop.html)
    what you are learning.

Bests,
