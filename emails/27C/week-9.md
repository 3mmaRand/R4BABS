# 🧡💻 BIO00027C-Week 9: Data Analysis in R for BABS 1

🦦 Hello Everyone,

We are in week 8 and this email is about *week 9*.

## 9️⃣ What is happening in week 9

Last week you summarised and plotted single variables. This week you
will start plotting data sets with more than one variable. This means
you need to be able determine which variable is the response and which
is the explanatory. You will find out what is meant by "tidy" data and
how to perform a simple data tidying task. Finally you will discover how
to save your figures and place them in documents. The figures you learn
how to make in this workshop will be like those you want on your poster.
The materials are on the VLE: Week 9 Data Analysis in R (or [Week 9
without
2FA](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-9/overview.html)).

There is:

-   An overview of the week.

-   Some independent study to
    [Prepare!](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-9/study_before_workshop.html)
    for the workshop which will allow you to revise data import and read
    about summarising and plotting data with several variables.

-   [workshop](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-9/workshop.html)
    where you will learn to summarise and plot datasets with more than
    one variable, and how to write figures to files. You will also get
    more practice with working directories, paths, importing data,
    formatting figures and the pipe. There will be seals 🦭, pigeons 🕊️
    (the dove was the taxonomically nearest emoji) and bones 🦴. You'll
    make a figure about myoglobin in seals which is similar to what you
    might want for your poster

    ![Myoglobin concentration (y axis) in three species of seal (x
    axis)](seal-muscle.png){width="400"}

-   some independent study for after the workshop to
    [Consolidate](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-9/study_after_workshop.html)
    what you are learning.

Bests,

Emma
