# 🧡💻 BIO00027C-Week 8: Data Analysis in R for BABS 1

🌊 Hello Everyone,

We are in week 7 and this email is about *week 8*.

## 8️⃣ What is happening in week 8

This week is about the types of variables and summarising data. The type
of values our data can take is important in how we analyse and visualise
it. You will learn the difference between continuous and discrete values
and how we summarise and visualise them. You will also learn about the
“normal distribution” which is the most important continuous
distribution. The materials are on the VLE: Week 8 Data Analysis in R
(or [Week 8 without
2FA](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-8/overview.html)).

There is:

-   An overview of the week.
-   Some independent study to
    [Prepare!](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-8/study_before_workshop.html)
    for the workshop which covers important concepts about data. It
    explains why we choose the summaries and figures we make in the
    workshop.
-   The
    [workshop](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-8/workshop.html)
    where you will learn how to import data from files and create
    summaries and plots for it. You will also get more practice using
    working directories and paths, formatting figures and the pipe.
    There will be 🐈cats, 🦟flies and 🧫cells.
-   And some independent study for after the workshop to
    [Consolidate](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/week-8/study_after_workshop.html)
    what you are learning. You'll make a boxplot:
