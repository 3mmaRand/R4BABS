😨I'm behind!! 🧡💻 BIO00027C Data Analysis in R for BABS 1

🤗 Hello Everyone,

If you have fallen behind in Data Analysis in R, please don't panic!

You are not directly assessed on your individual R work in 27C. Of
course, the skills being taught are important for later degree work and
you *are* directly assessed on individual R work in Semester 2 (26C),
but for the moment, you have plenty of time to be ready for that.

If you have not yet been to a workshop, try to make it this week. It is
always ok to be working on material from earlier weeks and lots of
people have done that.

If whatever stopped you going so far will continue this week here is
some advice for catching up before semester 2.

-   Materials are progressive so start from the beginning and work
    through methodically. Doing the Prepare work before the workshop
    will help
-   I do a short introduction/demo at the start of every workshop. These
    are recorded and you can find them in the Replay section of the VLE.
    I use these to emphasize key aspects of the independent study,
    demonstrate good practice in workflow and point out parts of the
    workshop to look out for.
-   Use the [Virtual Desktop
    Service.](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/tools/vds/) The VDS
    allows you to log on to a university computer from your own
    computer. It means you can access all software and filestores. When
    using the VDS for R and RStudio, it usually makes sense to use other
    software - such as a browser or file explorer - also through the
    VDS. Go to the [Virtual Desktop
    Service](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/tools/vds/) for set up
    instructions. If you use the VDS you do not need to install R,
    RStudio or any packages

Don't forget that any progress is better than none

Bests,
