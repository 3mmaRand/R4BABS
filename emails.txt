💚💻 BIO00026C Data Analysis in R for BABS 2 demonstrating


Hi GTA team!
It is fantastic to have your involvement in this stage 1 module. It would be impossible to teach this module without your help so thank you very much. The workshops are in weeks 1 to 6

The easist way to access materials is Data Analysis in R for BABS 2 as there's no 2FA and it's only the data analysis material rather than everything in the 26C module.

I think many of you have demonstrated for stage 1 Data Analysis in R before. BABS 2 covers the logic of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, what is meant by a statistical model, two-sample tests and one- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

I send a weekly email to students 0800 Wednesday about the following week and I will copy all of you in on all of those. They will be easy to find/search for in your inboxes 💚💻 BIO00026C. The first of these goes out tomorrow. 

I emphasise the use of RStudio projects (not using setwd), relative paths, and use the tidyverse and the (native) pipe (|>). Please also use these even when you know other ways - consistency is really helpful for new users. 

I'm very happy to answer any queries you have about the material but you'll probably find each other have the most useful perspective! 

Best wishes and see you soon,

Emma

💚💻 BIO00026C Data Analysis in R for BABS 2

👋 Hello Everyone,

TL,DR: 
R for BABS2 is organised like R for BABS1
Email coming on Wednesday about week 1
Do some revision of BABS1 

Next week you start the Data Analysis in R part of BABS 2. Over six weeks you will learn about the logic of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, what is meant by a statistical model, two-sample tests and one- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

The organisation of 💚 Data Analysis in R for BABS 2 is just like it was for 🧡Data Analysis in R for BABS 1:
Each week has:
An overview which gives the Learning Objectives, a topic summary and the instructions for the week. You should read this first.

Some independent study to “Prepare!” you for the workshop. It is designed to take about 30-45 mins on average. 

A two-hour workshop using R. This will usually start with me doing a short demonstration of one or more of the examples that were in “Prepare!” but you will spend most of the session going through some exercises. 

Some independent study to “Consolidate!” what you have learned. It is designed to take about 30-45 mins on average.

I will email each Wednesday 0800 with the Overview, links and instructions for the following week. So you will get Week 1 information shortly (if you just can't wait you can see it all without 2FA here: Data Analysis in R for BABS 2)

However, the main aim of this email is to encourage you to go through Data Analysis in R for BABS1 to revise and prepare you for this semester. You can access it through the BIO00027C BABS1 VLE site or without 2FA here: Data Analysis in R for BABS 21. Or by searching your inbox for 🧡💻 BIO00027C

bests,
Emma
