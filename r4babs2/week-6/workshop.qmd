## Philosophy

Workshops are not a test. It is expected that you often don't know how to start, make a lot of mistakes and need help. It is expected that you are familiar with independent study content before the workshop. However, you need not remember or understand every detail as the workshop should build and consolidate your understanding. Tips

-   don't worry about making mistakes
-   don't let what you can not do interfere with what you can do
-   discussing code with your neighbours will help
-   look things up in the independent study material
-   look things up in your own code from earlier 
-   there are no stupid questions

## Key

These four symbols are used at the beginning of each instruction so you know where to carry out the instruction.

![](images/do_on_your_computer.png) Something you need to do on your computer. It may be opening programs or documents or locating a file.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Something you should do in RStudio. It will often be typing a command or using the menus but might also be creating folders, locating or moving files.

![](images/do_on_internet.png) Something you should do in your browser on the internet. It may be searching for information, going to the VLE or downloading a file.

![](images/answer.png) A question for you to think about and answer. Record your answers in your script for future reference.

# Getting started

![](images/do_on_your_computer.png) Start RStudio from the Start menu.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Go the Files tab in the lower right pane and click on the `...` on the right. This will open a "Go to folder" window. Navigate to a place on your computer where you keep your work. Click Open.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Make an RStudio project for this workshop by clicking on the drop-down menu on top right where it says `Project: (None)` and choosing New Project, then New Directory, then New Project. Navigate to the `data-analysis-in-r-2` folder and name the RStudio Project `week-6`.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Make new folders called `data-raw` and `figures`. You can do this on the Files Pane by clicking New Folder and typing into the box that appears.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Make a two new scripts called `correlation.R` and `chi-squared-tests.R` to carry out the rest of the work.

![](images/do_in_R.png) Add a comment to the script: `# Introduction to RStudio and your first graph`

# Independent study following the workshop

[Consolidate](study_after_workshop.qmd)

# The Code file

These contain all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not visible on the webpage.

The [workshop.qmd](workshop.qmd) file is the file I use to compile the practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary text to be interweaved to produce well-formatted reports including webpages. Right-click on the link and choose Save-As to download. You will be able to open the Rmd file in RStudio. Alternatively, [View in Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/R4BABS/blob/main/r4babs2/week-1/workshop.qmd).Coding and thinking answers are marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`
