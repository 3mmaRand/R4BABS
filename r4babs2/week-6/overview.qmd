This week you will learn how to test whether there is an association between two categorical variables using the chi-squared contingency test and how to test whether there is an association between two continuous variables using the correlation test.

### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   Explain the principles of correlation and chi-squared contingency tests
-   Select, appropriately correlation and chi-squared contingency tests
-   Apply and interpret a correlation and chi-squared contingency tests in R
-   Appreciate the difference between statistical significance and biological significance
-   Summarise and illustrate with appropriate R figures test results scientifically
