00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:08,650
Hello, in this presentation, I'm going to talk about the logic of hypothesis testing.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:14,000
So this is a slide I showed last week in which I very briefly referenced hypothesis testing.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And now I'm going to discuss the logic behind that a lot more. In short we have to have a null hypothesis of some kind.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we calculate the probability of getting our data

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
if that null hypothesis is true and if that probability is less than a particular value, we decide the null hypothesis is not true.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,550
And this is the approach for what we call frequentist or classical statistics.

7
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,170
It's not quite the approach we'd use for Bayesian statistics. Whoops.

8
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:52,410
Wrong slide. So with hypothesis testing, there are four steps that we go through.

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:00,000
The first thing we do is set up our null hypothesis. And that's the hypothesis of no effect.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll talk more about that next slide. And then we have to collect our data and we use that data to test our null hypothesis.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So we then determine the probability of our data

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
if the null hypothesis is true and if that probability is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And if that probability is greater than 0.05, then we do not reject the null hypothesis.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So rejecting the null hypothesis means you think there *is* an effect and not rejecting the null

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:55,830
hypothesis means you think there is no effect - you think the null hypothesis is true.

16
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:02,000
So I'm going to work on an example here using the national average birth weight.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,150
The national average birth weight is 3300 grams with a standard deviation of 900 grams.

18
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:16,000
And the question we're interested in is whether maternal poverty influences birth weight.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So our first step is to set up our null hypothesis.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,520
And in this case, our null hypothesis of no effect would be that maternal poverty does not affect birth weight.

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:43,380
So we would expect the babies of mothers in poverty to weigh the same as those from the national population.

22
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,000
So our null hypothesis is what we expect to happen, if nothing interesting biologically is occurring.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,830
So we would expect a mean of 3300 grams if poverty has no effect.

24
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:10,390
And all the babies would be from a bell shaped curve with a mean of three thousand three hundred.

25
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,000
So a second step is to collect the data to test this null hypothesis.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So we take a sample of 25 women. We want to collect samples that are definitely random samples,

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
meaning they are genuinely representative of the population we're interested in.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So we take a sample of 25 women who live in poverty and determine the birth weight of their baby.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,370
And then we calculate the statistic, which is the same as the one in our null hypothesis

30
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:53,320
So in our null hypothesis, we have a mean of 3300.

31
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,390
So we calculate the mean of this sample and it's 3000 grams.

32
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:06,000
So we can see that the babies of these women are lower weight than the national average.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But the question is, is that low enough? If we took a different sample of 20 of women who live in poverty,

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,720
would we have got a mean of 3000, or would we have got something nearer the national average?

35
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:32,410
So although we can say that this value is lower, we need a statistical way to see whether it's statistically lower.

36
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,530
So we need to try and work out how far away from the national average is too far away.

37
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,900
So the national average here is at the peak. We have a value of 3000.

38
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:55,000
So if the null hypothesis is true, then only this many samples would have a mean that low.

39
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And we're going to use the probability of getting data like ours

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
if the null hypothesis is true, to determine whether our value is realistic.

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So we're going to use probability to calculate what is the probability of getting a value like 3000,

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:28,000
if we're actually expecting a value of 3300. So what we interested in knowing is what's the probability of getting a 3000 or lower?

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because if you think 3000 is too low, then you definitely think a value of 2800 was too low.

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So all the samples in this tail have a particular probability

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,930
And that probability is actually 0.048

46
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:57,000
Now, you don't need to worry how that probability was calculated for the moment, although you will find out in week four.

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We can just work that out from knowing what these means are and what the standard deviation was.

48
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So the probability of having a value of 3000 or lower is 0.048

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:26,000
However, if we consider 3000 would be too unlikely,  then values of 3600 are equally unlikely.

50
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The really relevant probability is not just the probability of being 3000 or lower,

51
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
but also the probability of a 3600 or higher.

52
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So as these combined areas, that gives us our actual probability that we're interested in.

53
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And so this is a p value or a probability of 0.096

54
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So twice 0.048

55
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So that takes us on to step four, which is to compare our p value to this critical value of 0.05

56
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So we have a P value of 0.096

57
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So this is bigger than 0.05. So this is that second one here.

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Our P value, or probability, is bigger than 0.05

59
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,500
So we do not reject our null hypothesis.

60
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:45,000
So we've got no reason to think that the babies born to mothers in poverty are lighter than those born to women in the national population.

61
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So we're saying we've got no reason to reject our null hypothesis.

62
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, Ihave that slide twice!  So the p value is the probability of our data

63
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,690
if the null hypothesis is true. That's the definition of a P value.

64
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,000
So when we say P value, we're just talking about a probability.

65
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And it is literally the probability of getting a sample like we've got

66
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
given the null hypothesis is actually true. And we're comparing that to this critical value of 0.05

67
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,710
So 0.05 is a totally arbitrary level.

68
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:44,000
But it's one that we've agreed in science that we're gonna use. But it is totally arbitrary and it's a little bit crazy, to be honest.

69
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So if we instead had got a probability that was less than 0.05, we would be rejecting our null hypothesis.

70
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If we'd found the probability of getting a sample with a mean of three thousand or more extreme, was lower than 0.05

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,480
we'd be saying that there *was* an effect of maternal poverty.

72
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:20,000
So we'd be concluding that there was a significant difference between our sample and what we'd expect if there was no effect.

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Now, when you're doing hypothesis testing, there is a type of mistake you can make or a type of error

74
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you can make those errors are not mistakes that you can avoid -

75
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
they are inherent in the approach of hypothesis testing and is all related to the fact that you are calculating the probability of your data

76
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
if the null hypothesis is true. So we have some

77
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
truth. So the null hypothesis is either true or not.

78
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We don't know what's the case. So it's either true that maternal poverty has an effect or isn't true.

79
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So the null hypothesis is either that there is no effect or is false and

80
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:19,000
there is an effect. And then based on this probability value we calculate, we're going to decide whether to reject our null hypothesis or not.

81
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So if our null hypothesis is actually true and we reject it because we get a P value

82
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
which is lower than 0.05, we've made what's called a type one error.

83
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So that's going to happen one in 20 times - i.e.,

84
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So in 0.05 of the time

85
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So it's going to happen because sometimes you are going to get samples that really are that far away from 3300

86
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Even though there is no effect because you get unusual samples sometimes

87
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If, on the other hand,

88
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
...

89
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,850
If the null hypothesis is false and we reject it, then we have *not* made a mistake.

90
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:27,280
If the null hypothesis is true and we reject it, we've made a type one error.

91
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,000
On the other hand, if we don't reject the null hypothesis.

92
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,090
(we get a P value greater than 0.05) our  null hypothesis is in fact true

93
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:52,640
Then again, we've made no mistake. So this is decision we're making is correct for the true state of the null hypothesis.

94
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
If the null hypothesis is false.

95
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So if there really isn't an effect of maternal poverty and we've not rejected the null hypothesis, then we've made what's called a type two error.

96
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So in our particular case, we have a probability of

97
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
greater than 0.05

98
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Which was 0.096. And we decided, therefore, that all null hypothesis could not be rejected.

99
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So either is the case that the null hypothesis is true

100
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
there's either no effect or it's possible we made a type two error.

101
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,920
we can't know which that is. That's just inherent with the actual testing.

102
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:58,000
So that's all I'm going to say for this presentation. The key points are in this slide here.

103
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:09,140
So we have to set up a null hypothesis, which is there is no effect of something you're investigating.

104
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,160
You then collect data and you calculate the probability of getting data like that.

105
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:24,520
If the null hypothesis is true and if that probability is very small, less than nought point five, then we reject the null hypothesis.

106
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:33,000
We say probably there is an effect. But if that probability is large.

107
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,170
So greater than 0.05. Then we do not reject the null hypothesis.

108
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:48,040
And we suspect that there is no effect. OK, I'll see you in the workshops.
