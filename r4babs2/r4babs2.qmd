# Welcome!

Welcome to an exciting six-week journey into data analysis with R! 
In this part of the module, we’ll explore key concepts that are essential
for any budding bioscientist, including **the logic of hypothesis testing**, 
a foundation for making informed decisions based on data and 
**Statistical models** for analysing patterns and relationships across multiple 
variables.

This module builds on your skills from BABS1 step-by-step, helping you gain 
confidence in applying statistical tools to real-world bioscience problems. 
By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to analyse data to go with
your existing skills in summarising and plotting it.


## Module Learning Objectives

The BABS2 Module Learning outcomes that relate to the Data Analysis in R content are:

-   Think creatively to address a Grand Challenge by designing investigations with testable hypotheses and rigorous controls

-   Appropriately select classical univariate statistical tests and some non-parametric equivalents to a given scenario and recognise when these are not suitable

-   Use R to perform these analyses, reproducibly, on data in a variety of formats and present the results graphically

-   Communicate research in scientific reports and via oral presentation.

# How this part of the module is organised

This module is designed to help you learn as you go — meaning you won’t need to 
spend hours revising. Instead, you’ll build skills gradually and steadily 
through a structured weekly schedule that combines contact time and guided 
independent study. The goal is to make learning manageable, effective, and 
enjoyable.

Each week has:

-   An "About" page which gives a topic summary, the Learning Objectives,  and 
    the instructions for the week. You should read this first.

-   Some independent study on the "Prepare!" page to help you get ready for 
    the workshop. This will be reading from the course book ([Computational 
    Analysis for Bioscientists](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/)), 
    watching a video, or doing some coding or some set up. The preparation is 
    designed to take about 30-45 minutes on average. To make it more fun and 
    more productive, study with other people.

-   A two-hour workshop using R to apply concepts you are learning. We will 
    usually start with a demonstration of an example from the "Prepare!" tasks.
    You will spend most of the workshop diving into exercises, and building on 
    previous weeks’ skills while being introduced to new concepts. Anything you 
    have not done before is explained and guided but you will also have the 
    opportunity to solve problems using using the skills gained in previous 
    workshops on your own or with others. I often remind 
    you to take care of future you by making notes so you can look up your 
    previous work but you can also search the 
    [R4BABS](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/) site (search is top right). 
    
-   The "Consolidate!" page has independent exercises to reinforce what you’re
    learning. These are similar to the workshop activities but with less 
    guidance to encourage independent thinking. Occasionally, there will also 
    be some reading. It is designed to take about 30-45 mins on average but may
    be quicker if you understood the workshop very well or slower if you need 
    to revisit parts.

# Tips for Learning R:

Learning R is a bit like learning a new language, picking up a musical
instrument, or mastering a sport — you can’t cram it all at once. Consistency 
is key. Even small, regular practice sessions are more effective than trying 
to do it all in one go.

-   a little bit of engagement and practice is always better than none, so 
    celebrate bit effort!

-   if you fall behind, don’t stress. Just pick up where you left off — there’s 
    no need to skip ahead. It is fine to work on a previous week’s workshop!
