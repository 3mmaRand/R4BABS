This week we will cover the logic of consider the logic of hypothesis testing and type 1 and type 2 errors. We will also find out what the sampling distribution of the mean and the standard error are, and how to calculate confidence intervals.

The population is saying 'yes, I'm still sure I birthed both of you'. Because these samples are relatively rare - would happen less than 5% of the time - we would conclude they did not come from this population. That would be making a type 1 error." width="600"}

There are two samples, one which happens to have at mean at the low end of one population and and the other at the high end of the other population so that the two samples are close togther. Deciding these two samples were from the same population would be making a type 2 error." width="600"}


### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   demonstrate the process of hypothesis testing with an example 

-   explain type 1 and type 2 errors

-   define the sampling distribution of the mean and the standard error

-   explain what a confidence interval is

-   calculate confidence intervals for large and small samples
