# Introduction

This module introduces you to data analysis in R. The first 4 weeks
covers core concepts about scientific computing, types of variable, the
role of variables in analysis and how to use RStudio to organise
analysis and import, summarise and plot data. In weeks 5 to 9, you will
learn about the logic of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, what
is meant by a statistical model, two-sample tests and one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA). In week 10 we will introduce the format of the 
assessment and in week 11 there will be a dedicated drop in session to
consolidate learning and ask any further questions about the module or
assessment.

This module complement the work you will do in BIO00070M Research,
Professional and Team Skills where you will you will learn how to
organise reproducible data analyses using a project-oriented workflow
and analyses RNA sequence data. It will be important to use the skills
and tools you learn in 52M and apply them in 70M.

## Module Learning Objectives

The Module Learning outcomes are:

-   Explain the purpose of data analysis and the rationale for scripting
    analysis in the biosciences

-   Recognise when statistics such as t-tests, one-way ANOVA,
    correlation and regression can be applied, and use R to perform
    these analyses on data in a variety of formats

-   Summarise data in single or multiple groups, recognise tidy data
    formats, and carry out some typical data tidying tasks

-   Understand what parts of your results are important to report

# How 52M is organised

A key feature of 52M is that you really do learn as you go along and you
should not need to revise very much. To support this learning, every
week is structured in the same way with contact time and well-guided
independent study to prepare you for the contact time and consolidate
what you have learned.

Each week has:

-   An overview on the "About" page which gives the Learning Objectives,
    a topic summary and the instructions for the week. You should read
    this first.

-   Some independent study on the "Prepare!" page to prepare you for the
    workshop. This will be reading from the course book [Computational
    Analysis for Bioscientists](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/)
    [@Rand_Comp_Analysis], watching a video, or doing some coding or set
    up. It is designed to take about 30-45 mins on average. You will
    most likely learn best if you can find people to study with.

-   A two-hour workshop using R. This will usually start with me doing a
    short demonstration of one or more of the examples that were in
    "Prepare!" but you will spend most of the session going through some
    exercises. Anything you have not done before is explained and guided
    but you will also have to use the skills gained in previous
    workshops. I often remind you to take care of future you by making
    notes so you can look up your previous work but you can also search
    the [Data Analysis in R](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/) site
    (search is top right). Talking to other people in the workshop about
    the exercises and working together will really help you understand
    more. There will be plenty of help from me and my demonstrators.

-   Some independent study on the "Consolidate!" page to give you more
    practice. The exercises are usually similar to those in the workshop
    but with less guidance. Occasionally, there will be reading to do.
    It is designed to take about 30-45 mins on average but may be
    quicker if you understood the workshop very well or slower if you
    need to revisit the workshop.

Learning Data Analysis in R is like learning to speak a new language or
play an instrument or a technical sport - you can't really rush it or
cram for it. You need regular practice.

-   a little bit of engagement and practice is always better than none

-   if you get behind, just pick up where you left off rather than
    jumping in. It is fine to work on a previous week's workshop

# Content

## [Week 1: Understanding file systems](week-1/ovwerview.html)

This week you will carry out some independent study to ensure you have
some understanding of computer file systems. We will introduce you to
the concepts of paths and working directories.

## [Week 2: Introduction to R and project organisation](week-2/ovwerview.html)

This week you will start writing R code in RStudio and will create your
first graph! You will learn about data types such as “numerics” and
“characters” and some of the different types of objects in R such as
“vectors” and “dataframes”. These are the building blocks for the rest
of your R journey. You will also learn a workflow and about the layout
of RStudio and using RStudio Projects.

## [Week 3: Types of variable, summarising and plotting data](week-3/ovwerview.html)

This week you will start writing R code in RStudio and will create your
first graph! You will learn about data types such as “numerics” and
“characters” and some of the different types of objects in R such as
“vectors” and “dataframes”. These are the building blocks for the rest
of your R journey. You will also learn a workflow and about the layout
of RStudio and using RStudio Projects.

## [Week 4: Summarising data with several variables](week-4/ovwerview.html)

Last week you summarised and plotted data sets with one variable. This
week you will start plotting data sets with more than one variable. This
means you need to be able determine which variable is the response and
which is the explanatory. You will find out what is meant by “tidy” data
and how to perform a simple data tidying task. Finally you will discover
how to save your figures to file.

## [Week 5: The logic of hypothesis testing and CI](week-5/ovwerview.html)

This week we will cover the logic of consider the logic of hypothesis
testing and type 1 and type 2 errors. We will also find out what the
sampling distribution of the mean and the standard error are, and how to
calculate confidence intervals.

## [Week 6: Introduction to statistical models: Single regression](week-6/ovwerview.html)

This week, you’ll learn about statistical *models*, which are
mathematical representations of data relationships. Specifically, you’ll
explore the *general linear model (GLM)*, a broad framework for
analysing data patterns.

Your first GLM will be *simple linear regression*, which fits a straight
line to data to predict a *response variable* (outcome) based on an
*explanatory variable* (predictor). We’ll examine the two key
*parameters* estimated in this model: the *slope* (which shows how the
predictor influences the outcome) and the *intercept* (the value when
the predictor is zero). We’ll also assess whether these values are
significantly different from zero.

## [Week 7: Two-sample tests](week-7/ovwerview.html)

This week you will how to use and interpret the general linear model
when the explanatory (or *x*) variable is categorical with two possible
values. These tests are also known as *t*-tests. Just as with single
linear regression, the response variable is continuous, the model puts a
line of best through data and has two parameters called the intercept
and the slope. These have the same in interpretation as they do in
linear regression. The intercept is one of the group means, and the
slope is the difference between that mean and the other group mean. You
will also learn about the non-parametric tests we use when the
assumptions of the general linear model are not met.

## [Week 8: One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis](week-8/ovwerview.html)

Last week you learnt how to use and interpret the general linear model
when the *x* variable was categorical with two groups. You will now
extend that to situations when there are more than two groups. This is
often known as the one-way ANOVA (**an**alysis **o**f **var**iance). You
will also learn about the Kruskal-Wallis test which can be used when the
assumptions of the general linear model are not met.

## [Week 9: Two-way ANOVA](week-9/ovwerview.html)

This week you will learn how to use and interpret a two-way ANOVA. 
Last week you learnt how to interpret a general linear model with one
categorical explanatory variable and this week we will extend this to
include two categorical explanatory variables. It allows us to design
experiments which test whether a response is influenced by two variables
and whether those variables act independently or interact.

## [Week 10: Introduction to the assessment](week-10/ovwerview.html)

This week, we will introduce you to the assessment for this module.
We will look at a specimen assessment using techniques you have already
learned and apply them to analysing a dataset. Your assessment will use
a different dataset but you will apply the same principles. We will be
covering what your assessment submission should contain using this example.

## Week 11: Drop-in

This session contains no set material however, we will cover topics that
people have had difficulty with during the course and cover any material
you may still be struggling with from the workshops. This will be our
last timetabled session to ask questions prior to the asessment release
and a good opportunity to ask any outstanding questions. No questions
are silly questions!
