So far you have learnt how to use and interpret the general linear model
when:

-   theÂ *x*Â variable was continuous
-   theÂ *x*Â variable was categorical with two groups
-   theÂ *x*Â variable was categorical with two or more groups

This week we will extend of our understanding by learning how to include
*two* categorical explanatory variables in a general linear model. This
model is often known as the two-way ANOVA. It allows us to design
experiments to test whether a response is influenced by two variables
*and* whether those two variables act independently on the response or
interact in some way.

### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   combine dataframes of the same structure

-   select, appropriately, two-way ANOVA

-   apply and interpret `lm()` for a two-way ANOVA

-   evaluate whether the assumptions of `lm()` are met

-   understand the meaning of the interaction term

-   scientifically report a two-way ANOVA result including appropriate
    figures
