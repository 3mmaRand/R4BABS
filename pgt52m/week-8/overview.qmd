subtitle: "One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis"
---

Last week you learnt how to use and interpret the general linear model when the *x* variable was categorical with two groups. You will now extend that to situations when there are more than two groups. This is often known as the one-way ANOVA (**an**alysis **o**f **var**iance). You will also learn about the Kruskal- Wallis test which can be used when the assumptions of the general linear model are not met.

### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   explain the rationale behind ANOVA understand the meaning of the F values 

-   select, appropriately, one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis 

-   know what functions are used in R to run these tests and how to interpret them

-   evaluate whether the assumptions of `lm()` are met

-   scientifically report the results of these tests including appropriate figures
