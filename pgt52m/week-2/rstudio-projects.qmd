# Who?

## Audience

-   You teach using R directly
    -   Becoming a Bioscientist 1 - 4
    -   IM group project
    -   PGT
-   You teach or supervise students using R
    -   field courses, practical work
    -   projects
-   You use R

# A One-line what

## 📁 An RStudio Project

-   is a folder!

. . .

-   have been part of the stage 1 and IM stage 3 for \> 5 years

. . .

Stage 1

::: small
*Use an RStudio project containing the script you used to analyse and plot the data for your report, your figures and and the data itself. The Project should be structured and the script should be well-commented, well-organised and follow good practice in the use of spacing, indentation, and variable naming. It should include all the code required to reproduce data import and formatting as well as the summary information, analyses, and figures in your report*.

# The high-level why

## Why use RStudio Projects

-   the same reason we keep lab books: reproducibility and validation

. . .

It's science!

# More detailed Why

## Working directories and Paths

-   directory means folder

-   important concepts when you interact with computers without clicking

![Allison Horst cartoon "code gets the blame"](/r4babs1/week-6/images/code_gets_the_blame.jpg){fig-alt="A charactered has slipped on a banana skin and is blaming the code character but the real culprits, holding bananas, are mismanaged files, navigating your computing and typos"}

## Working directories

-   Default folder a program will read and write to.

-   You will have some understanding

Word demo

## Paths

-   location of a file/folder

-   appear in the address bar of explorer/finder and browsers

demo

. . .

-   when you can't click, you need the path

```{r}
#| eval: false
chaffinch <- read_table("chaff.txt")

```

## Absolute path

```{r}
#| eval: false
chaffinch <- read_table("C:/Users/er13/OneDrive - University of York/Desktop/Desktop/undergrad-teaching-york/BIO00017C/BIO00017C-Data-Analysis-in-R-2020/data/chaff.txt")

```

. . .

Only exists on my computer!

## Relative paths

-   location of a file/folder relative to the working directory

-   If my working directory is BIO00017C-Data-Analysis-in-R-2020:

```{r}
#| eval: false
chaffinch <- read_table("data/chaff.txt")
```

## RStudio Projects

-   Sets the working directory to be the project folder

-   Code is portable: you send someone the folder and everything just works!
